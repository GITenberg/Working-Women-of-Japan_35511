<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Japan</span> is rapidly swinging into the current
of an industrial civilization imported from
the West. How is this movement modifying
her ancient civilization? And, especially,
what effect is it having on her homes
and on the character of her manhood and
womanhood? These are questions of profound
interest to students of national and
social evolution.</p>

<p class="indent">While many works on Japan consider
these questions more or less fully, they do
so almost exclusively from the standpoint of
the effect on men. So far as is known, no
work studies the problem from the standpoint
of the effect on women, who, it may
be incidentally remarked, constitute one
half of the population.</p>

<p class="indent">One book, indeed, that by Miss Alice M.
Bacon, on <i>Japanese Girls and Women</i>, describes
the homes, lives, and characteristics
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;x]</span>
of Japanese women. This important work
should not be overlooked by any who wish
to know Japan thoroughly. Yet Miss Bacon's
study is largely confined to the higher and
upper middle classes, who, though important,
constitute but one section of the women
of Japan. To understand Japan it is also
needful to know the lives and characteristics
of the working classes. Especially important
in the eyes of those who study social
development is the transformation that is
taking place in the Japanese home because
of the influx of Occidental industrialism.</p>

<p class="indent">The purpose of this book is to give some
information as to conditions prevailing
among working women, which conditions
have called for the establishment of institutions
whose specific aim is the amelioration
of the industrial and moral situation. Two
classes of workers have not been considered&mdash;school-teachers
and nurses.</p>

<p class="indent">The reader will naturally ask what the
native religions have done to help women
meet the modern situation. The answer
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xi]</span>
is short; practically nothing. They are seriously
belated in every respect. For ages the
native religions have served by doctrine and
practise to hold women down rather than
to elevate them. The doctrine of the "triple
obedience" to father, to husband, and when
old to son, has had wide-reaching and disastrous
consequences. It has even been utilized
for the support of the brothel system. Popular
Buddhism, especially during the feudal
era, has emphasized the inherent sinfulness
of woman; some have even taught that her
lightest sins are worse than the heaviest sins
of man. The brothel system flourishes in
certain districts where Buddhism is most
strongly entrenched. Brothels abound in the
immediate vicinity of famous and popular
temples. I have yet to hear of a Buddhist
anti-brothel movement or a Buddhist rescue
home for prostitutes. Japanese philanthropy,
under the impulse of Buddhism, did indeed
start early and attain striking development
at the hands of Imperial and princely personages.
Men and women of lowly origin
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xii]</span>
also attained high rank in the annals of
Buddhist philanthropy. With the decay of
Buddhism in recent centuries, however, little
philanthropic activity has survived. With
the revival of Buddhism Buddhists have
again undertaken philanthropic work; they
have established orphan asylums, schools, ex-convict
homes, and various benevolent enterprises
for the poor, the old, and invalids;
but not yet do they seem to appreciate the
moral and industrial situation, or undertake
anything commensurate with their numbers
and resources. The conception of private
enterprise for the amelioration of industrial
difficulties and moral need is still the almost
exclusive possession of Christians.</p>

<p class="indent">The closing chapter describes one institution
in which the Christian ideal is applied
to the moral and industrial situation
in one small town. It serves as an illustration
of what is being done by Christians
in other places and along many other lines
as well. Christianity is being accepted in
Japan, not so much because of its doctrine,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xiii]</span>
as because of its practical methods of inspiring
and uplifting manhood and womanhood.
While the purpose of this book is,
as stated, to describe the industrial condition
and the characteristics of Japanese working
women, back of this purpose is the desire
to show how the Christian gospel, when
concretely expressed, takes hold of Japanese
working women in exactly these conditions
and becomes to them "the power of God
unto salvation."</p>

<p class="indent">The problems of life are substantially the
same the world around, for human nature
is one; and the heart with its needs, desires,
temptations, defeats, and victories is essentially
the same, East or West. The problems
created by industrialism do not differ,
whether in Germany, England, and America
or in Japan and China. And their fundamental
solution likewise is the same.</p>

<p class="indent">Let not the reader assume that the discussions
of this volume give adequate acquaintance
with the working women of
Japan. It deals with only a few specific
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xiv]</span>
classes and inadequately even with them.
A more comprehensive treatment would
doubtless be enlightening. Limitations, however,
of time and space forbid a more adequate
discussion.</p>

<p class="indent">And let the reader be wary of generalizing
certain criticisms herein made and applying
them universally to all classes of women.
Many years of life in Japan have led the
writer to a high estimation of the character
as well as the culture of Japanese women.</p>

<p class="indent">Especial thanks are due to Colonel Yamamuro
for valued criticisms and suggestions
in the preparation of this work. The responsibility,
however, for its statements rests
upon the writer. The limitations of this
book none can feel more than he.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h2a">SOCIAL CLASSES IN JAPAN, OLD AND NEW</p>

<p class="cap">IN old Japan, next to the Imperial family
and court nobles, came the feudal lords
(<i>Daimio</i>), upheld by the warrior class
(<i>Samurai</i>), below whom in turn were ranked
the three chief working classes,&mdash;farmers,
artizans, and tradesmen. These three classes
produced and distributed the nation's wealth
and paid taxes to their respective feudal lords
by whom the warriors were supported. Below
all were day laborers and palanquin
bearers,&mdash;in those days a large and important
though a despised class, for they lived entirely
by bare, brute strength, lacking all
special skill. Still lower were the <i>eta</i> or
pariah class, excluded from towns and villages,
except when they entered to do the
foulest work, such as digging the graves
of criminals and the slaughtering of animals,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;2]</span>
and curing their skins. And lowest of all
were <i>hi-nin</i>, literally translated "non-humans."
These were beggars and criminals,
who would not or could not work.
The name, popularly given, well indicates
how they were regarded.</p>

<p class="indent">With the fall of the feudal system, in the
early seventies, society was reorganized.
Those above the Samurai were divided in
1886 into five grades, not counting the Imperial
princes, namely: prince, marquis,
count, viscount, and baron. These constitute
to-day the hereditary peers of Japan, and
possess considerable wealth and, of course,
overwhelming prestige.</p>

<p class="indent">They numbered, in 1903, 1,784 families.
Besides the 1,784 heads of these families,
there were 1,786 male and 2,485 female members
of these families of rank. The number
of these peers is constantly being increased
by Imperial favor, the conferring of rank
being the customary method of rewarding
distinguished service. According to the
<i>Japan Year Book</i> for 1914, the number of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;3]</span>
peers in 1911 was 919, there being 17 princes,
37 marquises, 101 counts, 378 viscounts, and
386 barons. Promotion from one rank to
another causes constant change in the numbers
of the various ranks.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Samurai</i>, deprived of their swords and
military privileges, were given the name
<i>shizoku</i> (Samurai families) and were paid
off in lump sums, thereafter being thrown
on their own resources. There are 439,154
shizoku families, numbering altogether
2,169,018 individuals. The remaining classes
were designated as <i>heimin</i> (common people).
Statistics show that they number 8,471,610
families, totaling 44,558,025 individuals.
The eta were elevated, hence popularly
called <i>shin-heimin</i> (new common people)
and allowed to live anywhere and take up
any desirable calling. The hi-nin also were
classed along with the rest of humankind.
As a matter of fact, the eta and hi-nin were
but a small fringe of the whole population,
the descendants of the former being now estimated
at something less than one million,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
and those of the latter amounting to about
35,000.</p>

<p class="indent">With the national reorganization it was
inevitable that the new executive offices
from the highest to the lowest should be
given to men of experience. At first, therefore,
the reorganization amounted to little
more than a great shuffle of names and titles.
Peers took the highest governmental positions,
while Samurai and their sons as a rule
filled the lower posts. Many Samurai, however,
received no appointments and had to
go to work. In time, as education has progressed,
sons of farmers and merchants have
become qualified and have been appointed
to government offices. The new departments,
such as the educational, the postal and telegraph
offices, the railroads, and especially
the army and navy, call for large numbers
of efficient men. These posts are filled almost
entirely on the basis of fitness. While
ancestry is not entirely ignored in the making
of appointments, nevertheless old class
distinctions are gradually being obliterated.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
The fortunes of the women have naturally
followed those of the men. All families that
lost their hereditary income had to go to
work; this was true chiefly of the Samurai.
Where the men were fortunate, the women
could maintain the old customs, limiting
themselves to their familiar domestic work,
with a servant or two to help, but tens of
thousands of Samurai families found themselves
reduced to the direst poverty; women
having generations of genteel ancestry were
forced to enter the ranks of the workers.</p>

<p class="indent">Let us define what we mean by a working
woman. Women whose husbands or parents
provide the support of the family are
not to be included in this term. These
women may, and indeed doubtless do, labor
abundantly and fruitfully in the home; their
time is fully occupied. Probably no working
women toil more diligently or for longer
hours than do these wives and mothers in
hundreds of thousands of homes, in most
of which there are no servants. All the
cooking, sewing, and housecleaning is done
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
by them, so that they are indeed workers.
But they are not "working women." They
are the true gentlewomen of Japan, whose
culture, graces, and charms are not easily
described.</p>

<p class="indent">By "working women" we mean only those
women who, in addition to the regular duties
of the home, must share in the labor
of earning the daily bread. In Japan the
number of such is exceptionally large, if
compared with that of some countries of
the West. They may be divided into eleven
classes, according to the nature of their occupations,
namely: school-teachers, nurses,
clerks and office girls, farmers, home industrial
workers, factory hands, domestics, baby-tenders,
hotel and tea-house girls, geisha,
and prostitutes. Omitting the teachers and
nurses, these are the classes whose conditions,
numbers, education, and character we
are now to study. Taken as a whole we do
not hesitate to say that the working women
of Japan, while probably lower in point of
moral and physical energy and personal initiative
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
than corresponding classes of the
West, are not inferior to them in point of
personal culture. And if civilization is
defined, as it should be, in terms of personal
culture rather than in those of mechanical
contrivances and improvements, then
Japan will surely take her place among the
highly civilized nations of the world.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h2a">FARMERS' WIVES AND DAUGHTERS</p>

<p class="cap">JAPAN has three leading wealth-earning
occupations: agriculture, sericulture, and
factory work. In each of these women take
an important part. In the cultivation of the
soil farmers' wives and daughters share
equally with men the toil of planting and
reaping the crops. For instance, in the cultivation
of rice, the most important and the
hardest work of the farmer, it is often the
women who plant it spear by spear in regular
rows, and it is they who "puddle" the
paddy-fields with their hands four or five
times in the course of the season. In some
districts, however, men and women do this
work together. The toil and the weariness
involved cannot be appreciated by one who
has not actually shared it. Fancy, if you
can, the fatigue of standing more than ankle
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
deep in mud, stooping all day long as you
set out the tiny rice plants in regular lines!
And at short intervals of a few days each you
must repeatedly puddle the whole paddy-field:
that is, stir up the mud with your
hands in order to destroy the sprouting
weeds and prevent the soil from caking and
hardening around the tender rice roots, preventing
their best growth. And remember
that you must do all this regardless of the
broiling summer sun, or the pelting rain, for
the planting must be done at exactly the right
time, and the successive puddlings must follow
in due order. So severe is the strain
that, after the planting and each puddling,
the whole village takes a rest. My gardener,
an ex-farmer, speaking of those summer days
of toil in the rice-fields, expatiates on the
extreme fatigue and the joy of the rest days,
and as women take the brunt of the stooping-work,
theirs is the lion's share of the weariness.
He says that, during the rice-planting
season, the women are so important that
those days are called the "women's daimio
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
days," and adds that we must not forget
how during that time the regular work of
the women must also go on, for they must
cook the food and care for the children. For
this, indeed, young girls and grandmothers
are pressed into service as far as possible,
but the responsibility and care rest nevertheless
on the wives and mothers.</p>

<p class="indent">Also in the harvesting and threshing of
the rice, barley, wheat, and millet, women
take an important part. But it is needless
to enter into details. Enough to say that,
in general farming, women share with husbands
and brothers the heavy toil and fatigue
of agriculture. It should be added that
this is not because men shirk heavy work,
but only because Japanese agriculture is so
largely done by hand that every possible
worker is pressed into service. As a fact,
men do the heaviest part of the work, preparing
the soil for the successive crops and
carrying the heavy loads.</p>

<p class="indent">So varied are the modes of agriculture in
different parts of Japan that general statements
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
are dangerous, but I know that in some
districts the weariness and drudgery of rice-planting
and puddling are relieved by the
singing or chanting of old folk-songs. The
chorus leader intones a descriptive phrase,
oftentimes improvising his own story, and is
answered with a refrain from a dozen or a
score of women. A story slowly evolves as
the hours pass, and thus the work is lightened
and the time beguiled.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of fatigue, rice-planting has its
charm for those who have been reared in
farmers' homes. It is a time of hope, of
social intercourse, of rest days and festivals,
so that even the drudgery of the farmer has
its compensations. Miss Denton, of the
Doshisha Girls' School, says it is interesting
to note how country girls get restless at rice-planting
time, and for one reason or another
usually succeed in getting excused from
school work, to be off to the homes and share
in the toils and joys of the season.</p>

<p class="indent">Tea-picking is probably the pleasantest
form of toil undertaken by farmers' wives
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
and daughters. The labor comes in the
spring and early summer, when the temperature
is delightful. It gives opportunity for
social intercourse that is highly appreciated.
Rice-planting and tea-picking constitute the
two extremes of laborious and delightful toil
engaged in by Japan's agricultural women.</p>

<p class="indent">How many are the women engaged in
agriculture? The <i>Japan Year Book</i> for
1914 says that in 1912 there were 5,438,051
farming families, constituting about 58 per
cent. of the entire nation. According to the
<i>Résumé Statistique</i> for 1914 the total number
of females in Japan proper, in 1908, was
24,542,383. Omitting those under fifteen
years of age, 8,364,000, and those over sixty
years of age, 2,216,000, we have 13,962,000 as
the number of able-bodied women, of whom
58 per cent., or 8,077,000, are the farmers'
wives and daughters.</p>

<p class="indent">In regard to their education it may be said
that until the most recent times they have
had practically none. In recent decades,
however, farmers' children have begun to go
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
to school. Until 1908 the elementary course
(compulsory) covered four years, but the
results were so poor that the period has now
been extended to six. Four years' schooling
does not give ability to read easily even a
simple daily paper, much less an ordinary
book. Our cook, an intelligent and able
farming woman, when she came to us twelve
years ago, could not read even the simplest
Japanese characters, and thinks that at present
relatively few farmers' wives have enough
education to read papers or write letters.
Whether or not six years' schooling will give
this ability remains to be seen. It is safe
to say that to-day Japanese adult farming
women, as a whole, lack book education and
have received little, if any, systematic training.
They are accordingly largely controlled
by tradition, and it goes without saying
that their level of mental, moral, and
spiritual life is low. The Shinto and Buddhist
religions, as they exist among the farmers,
are largely lacking in ethical content;
they are rituals rather for burying the dead
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
and through the use of charms and magic
rites they promise future happiness and present,
temporal blessings. Priests, as a rule,
do not seek to cultivate the minds of the
people, to strengthen their wills for moral
life, or to elevate their personalities.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet it must not be inferred that farming
women are without mental ability or common
sense. They are indeed not inferior
to the men with whom they share the burdens
and toil of life. As a rule they are a
sturdy, intelligent, self-respecting folk, having
ideals of conduct which include cleanliness,
gentleness, and politeness, and in comparison
with the peasant classes of Europe
are much to be commended. The women not
seldom appear to better advantage than their
husbands in point of intelligence and common
sense, which I have thought might be
due to the greater variety of their daily
occupation.</p>

<p class="indent">In her excellent work on <i>Japanese Girls
and Women</i> Miss Bacon writing of this class
says: "There seems no doubt at all that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
among the peasantry of Japan one finds the
women who have the most freedom and independence.
Among this class, all through
the country, the women, though hard-worked
and possessing few comforts, lead lives of
intelligent, independent labor, and have in
the family positions as respected and honored
as those held by women in America.
Their lives are fuller and happier than those
of the women of the higher classes, for they
are themselves breadwinners, contributing
an important part of the family revenue, and
are obeyed and respected accordingly. The
Japanese lady, at her marriage, lays aside
her independent existence to become the
subordinate and servant of her husband and
parents-in-law, and her face, as the years
go by, shows how much she has given up,
how completely she has sacrificed herself
to those about her. The Japanese peasant
woman, when she marries, works side by
side with her husband, finds life full of
interest outside of the simple household work,
and, as the years go by, her face shows more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
individuality, more pleasure in life, less suffering
and disappointment than that of her
wealthier and less hard-working sister."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The home of the average tenant farmer is
a small, single-storied, thatch-roofed building,
having usually two or three small rooms
separated by sliding paper screens, and a
kitchen with earthen floor. The smoke escapes
as it can, passing through the roof or
pervading the whole house. No privacy of
any kind is possible, nor is any need of it
felt. The house is free of furniture, save
for one or two chests of drawers. A closet
or two affords a place for the <i>futon</i> (bedding)
by day, and for the little extra clothing.
Of course no books are found in such
homes. The main room often has a board
floor, with a fire box in the center, over
which is a kettle suspended from the roof.
Here the family eat, and friends gather to
chat after the day's work is over. The food
is of the poorest grade in the empire, though
usually adequate in amount. Of course
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
there are well-to-do farmers, not a few, who
own their farms, employ fellow farmers, and
cultivate large areas. Their homes are larger
and better, but still in arrangement and structure
they are practically the same. Their
sons attend the middle schools and books and
the daily paper are familiar objects.</p>

<p class="indent">The economic condition of the farming
class may be judged from the fact that
the land cultivated by each family averages
three and one-third acres, which must provide
food and clothing for five or six persons.
The great majority of farmers live
in little, compact villages, having populations
ranging from 500 to 5,000. There are
12,706 villages under 5,000, and only 1,311
villages, towns, and cities over 5,000. These
facts suggest the nature of the social conditions
of the farming population. They
live under the severest limitations of every
kind, physical, intellectual, and spiritual.
Yet during the recent era of Meiji (enlightened
rule), from 1868 to 1912, the economic
condition of the agricultural classes made
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
great improvement. My gardener, a man of
sixty, who remembers Japan before the reformation,
1868, says that farmers now live
in luxury. The taxes they pay to-day are
slight compared with what was required of
them in former times, when, in his section,
farmers had to give to their Daimio about
five twelfth of the rice crop, while taxes
to-day require but one fifth or less. He
adds that families owning three and one third
acres of land are well-to-do, seeing many
families have to make their entire living from
only one acre!</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, farmers, without education or
social demands, require little beyond the
simplest food and shelter. The clothing
needed by their families is the cheapest cotton,
with cotton wadding added in the winter
for warmth. The heat of the summer renders
much clothing a burden. A farmer is
adequately dressed for the field or his own
home if he has on his loin-cloth. His wife
or grown-up daughter, when in the house
with only the immediate members of the family
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
or most intimate acquaintances present,
is satisfied with the <i>koshimaki</i>&mdash;a strip of
cloth some two feet wide tied around the
waist and covering the lower part of the
body. But on the street both men and women
conform to the national customs and wear the
kimono.</p>

<p class="indent">The Japanese household and bathing customs
have served to prevent the development
of that particular type of modesty characteristic
of Western lands. It is difficult for
Occidentals to understand this feature of
Japanese civilization, but such an understanding
is essential if one would do justice
to the moral life of this people. We may
not apply to them Occidental standards in
matters of modesty or dress. They have
standards of their own, to understand and
appreciate which requires no little study.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point, I venture a second quotation
from Miss Bacon, for she has studied
carefully this subject, which all foreigners
seeking to estimate the nature of Japanese
civilization and moral character should not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
fail to master. "As one travels," she writes,
"through rural Japan in summer, and sees
the half-naked men, women, and children
that pour out from every village on one's
route, surrounding the <i>kuruma</i> (wheeled
vehicle) at every stopping place, one sometimes
wonders whether there is in the country
any real civilization, whether these half-naked
people are not more savage than civilized.
But when one finds everywhere good
hotels, scrupulous cleanliness in all the appointments
of toilet and table, polite and
careful servants, honest and willing performance
of labor bargained for, together with
the gentlest and pleasantest of manners, one
is forced to reconsider the judgment formed
only upon one peculiarity of the national
life, and to conclude that there is certainly a
high type of civilization in Japan, though
differing in many particulars from our own.
A careful study of Japanese ideas of decency,
and frequent conversation with refined and
intelligent Japanese ladies upon this subject,
has led me to the following conclusion.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
According to the Japanese standard, any
exposure of the person that is merely incidental
to health, cleanliness, or convenience
in doing necessary work is perfectly modest
and allowable; but an exposure, no matter
how slight, that is simply for show, is in
the highest degree indelicate. In illustration
of the first part of this conclusion, I would
refer to the open bath-houses, the naked laborers,
the exposure of the lower limbs in wet
weather by the turning up of the kimono, the
entirely nude condition of the country children
in summer, and the very slight clothing
that some adults regard as necessary
about the house or in the country during
the hot season. In illustration of the last
point, I would mention the horror with
which many Japanese ladies regard that style
of foreign dress which, while covering the
figure completely, reveals every detail of the
form above the waist, and, as we say, shows
off to advantage a pretty figure. To the
Japanese mind, it is immodest to want to
show off a pretty figure. As for the ballroom
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
costumes, where neck and arms are
frequently exposed to the gaze of multitudes,
the Japanese woman who would with entire
composure take her bath in the presence
of others, would be in an agony of shame at
the thought of appearing in public in a costume
so indecent as that worn by many respectable
American and European women."<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This completes our study of the homes and
characteristics of five eighths of Japan. Here
the brawn of the nation is reared. Hence
come the sturdy, docile, patient, and courageous
soldiers. Here are raised boys and
girls by the hundreds of thousands who must
at an early age begin to earn a living. This
is the hunting-ground of those who seek for
builders of railroads, factory hands, domestics,
hotel girls, baby-tenders, and occasionally
geishas, concubines, and prostitutes.
Considering the severe economic conditions
under which Japan's agricultural classes live,
who can fail to admire their courage and
grit, their personal culture, their even temper
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
and cheerful faces, their innate habits of
courtesy and good breeding, their mutual
patience and forbearance, and their simple
artistic tastes and pleasures! Do they not
compare well with the peasant classes of any
other nation?</p>

<p class="h2a">DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES IN FARMING FAMILIES</p>

<p class="cap">BEFORE passing on to study the various
classes of workers constantly recruited
in no small numbers from the homes of
farmers, we should first consider the high
development of industrial occupations within
these homes themselves. To appreciate both
the opportunity and the need for this, we
turn to the official statistics of marriage and
education. Until 1908 compulsory education,
as has been already stated, covered four
years from the age of six to ten. According
to governmental statistics (1912) 98.8 per
cent. of the boys and 97.5 per cent. of the
girls were actually fulfilling the requirement.
This percentage seems high to American
statistical students, but investigations show
that, while Japanese rules for the attendance
of pupils and methods of counting the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
same differ in some respects from those that
prevail in the United States and Canada, yet,
as a matter of fact, in school attendance
Japan compares well with other lands. It
should be remembered, however, that the
nature of the Japanese written language is
such that even six years of elementary education
is probably not equal to four years
of similar schooling in Western lands.
American children, at the close of their elementary
education, possess a mastery of the
tools of civilization and a degree of general
intelligence considerably in advance of
Japanese children who have enjoyed the same
number of years of school life. As we have
already seen, this amount of compulsory education
is insufficient to give children ability
to read and write with freedom.</p>

<p class="indent">The question for us however is as to the
number of girls above school age and still
unmarried who, because of family poverty,
must find some form of wage-earning occupation.
Turning to the vital statistics provided
by the government (1914), we find
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
that in 1908 there were 2,496,142 girls between
ten and fifteen years of age, and 2,180,408
young women between fifteen and twenty
years of age. But how many of these are
married? Again relying on government statistics
for the same year, we learn that only
199 girls under fifteen had been married,
whereas 193,978 had married under twenty
years of age. In view of the fact that 709,021
marriages took place between twenty
and twenty-five years of age, it is altogether
probable that, of those married under twenty,
a large majority were married in their nineteenth
year. Remembering that many do
not marry until the twenty-third or twenty-fourth
year, we can confidently assert that
there are over 4,000,000 unmarried girls and
young women between the ages of ten and
twenty-five; and, as 58 per cent. belong to
the farming class, we have in the vicinity of
3,000,000 girls who belong to families of
such economic state that they, no less than
the boys, must contrive in some way to earn
a share at least of their own living. Girls of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
fifteen and upwards in farmers' families help
their fathers in the lighter forms of agriculture,
planting the rice, as we have seen,
and reaping and threshing the crops. But
the small acreage to each family barely provides
work enough for the man, much less
for the half-grown boys and girls, hence the
need of finding something besides the agricultural
work for the growing family. The
younger children (under fifteen) are pressed
into lighter farming, and such household duties
as are within their strength and ability,
as cooking and caring for the still younger
children; while the older children and the
mother help the father, or take up some domestic
industry, such as the rearing of silkworms,
reeling of silk, spinning of thread,
and weaving of silk and cotton fabrics, or
similar work which can be easily and profitably
done in the house in spare hours. Hence
has come the widespread practise of household
industries, by which the female members
supplement the family income. There
were, in 1907, 1,628,000 members of farming
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
families who were earning a part of
their living in this way. This condition has
prevailed for many generations, and is the
secret of the wonderful development of the
arts and home industries in Japan.</p>

<span class="caption">A FAMILY AT WORK IN A RICE-FIELD<br />

</div>

<p class="indent">From of old Japan's industrial system, like
that of other lands, has been domestic&mdash;carried
on in the house. There have been
families and gilds which have made their
entire livelihood by these manual industries.
There have also been hundreds of thousands
of farming families which have supplemented
their meager income from their farms by
taking up some of these domestic industries,
and those who have displayed or developed
special aptitude for such work have naturally
drifted into this wholly industrial life.
This has doubtless been the origin of industrial
families and gilds. But the point to be
especially noted is that this wide development
of domestic industries is due to the
skill and diligence of Japan's working
<i>women</i>. Japanese men have produced the
food by which the nation has been fed; her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
women have produced industries by which
the nation has been clothed, as indeed is the
case of all great civilized nations. Their
long-continued drill, from generation to generation,
in home industrial occupations, has
produced a high degree of manual dexterity;
the eye and hand instinctively move accurately
and rapidly in the work, and the result
is that Japan's leading industries to this
day are dependent on female labor. "Sericulture,
silk-reeling, cotton spinning, <i>habutae</i>
(a particular variety of silk fabric), and
other woven goods, tea-picking, straw and
chip braids, etc., are practically dependent on
female labor," says the <i>Japanese Year Book</i>
for 1910. "But an industry depending on
female labor has this peculiarity, namely:
it is not compatible with the factory system,
but thrives best on the domestic plan. Generally
speaking it is in industries which admit
of being carried on independently at separate
homes by housewives and mothers that
skilled female labor is seen to the best advantage.
As operatives of family industries
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Japanese women show an efficiency rarely
reached by their foreign sisters." But in this
connection we may remind ourselves of the
great skill and industry of our grandmothers
and preceding generations of women, who
lived before the great factory system made
their home industrial occupations unnecessary.
Japan is merely several decades behind
Western lands in her industrial development.</p>

<span class="caption">SPINNING COTTON THREAD FOR WEAVING<br />

</div>

<p class="indent">We are to understand, then, that a large
portion of these 3,000,000 unmarried Japanese
women and girls are engaged more or
less continuously in some sort of industrial
work, either in their own homes or in small
groups in their immediate vicinity. The
introduction into Japan of Occidental mechanical
civilization, with its great machinery
run by steam power, and the great
factory system, taking girls and young women
away from their home industries, home restraints,
and home training, is producing
mighty changes in Japan's traditional civilization.
The real consequences of these new
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
modes of life and labor are still little appreciated.
There is taking place a rapid readjustment
of population, which indeed is easily
seen, but the disastrous results to the
mental, moral, and religious life of the people,
even to the maintenance of the ideals
and standards that controlled the older arts
and industries, are yet little realized, for the
great changes have only begun within the
past two decades. A generation or two must
pass before we can see clearly what it all
really means. Meanwhile it is for those who
foresee coming evils to sound aloud the call,
and, as prophets, to do that which in them
lies to meet the threatened disasters, and
turn new conditions into blessings. Japan
has the advantage of a century of European
experience from which to learn wisdom. It
is to be hoped that she will avoid many
of the perils and evils into which the West
has fallen, but the signs of the times are
not altogether reassuring. There are, as we
shall see later on, ominous clouds on Japan's
industrial horizon.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h2a">SILK WORKERS</p>

<p class="cap">THE chief wealth-earning domestic industry
carried on by farmers' wives
and daughters is the rearing of silkworms
and the reeling, spinning, and weaving of
the silk. Japan supplies about 28 per cent.
of the total silk of the world and 60 per cent.
of that used in the United States. The
value of the silk exported in 1913 was
$63,000,000. Women are the chief workers,
contributing 90 per cent. of the labor. Here
again the toil is taxing beyond belief.</p>

<p class="indent">The brunt of the work consists first in
filling the mouths of the worms, which must
be fed at regular intervals night and day
for about three weeks, during the last few
days of which they eat continuously and voraciously.
It has been found that the rearing
of worms can best be done only on a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
small scale, where minute attention can be
given to each tray, almost to each worm.
This means that worms are reared in the
homes of the people, rather than in large
establishments. During the silkworm season
everything else must give way; the house
is filled with trays of ravenous worms; rest,
recreation, and sleep, for old and young alike,
are neglected in order that the precious
worms may get their fill. Men and boys
bring in the mulberry leaves from the hills
and fields, while women and girls strip the
branches, chop the leaves and feed them to
the magic creatures that transform worthless
green leaves into costly silk. The leaves must
not be damp, nor old, and every condition
of weather and temperature must be watched
with the closest care. Otherwise there is
loss. This heavy work comes twice each
year, in some places three times. That is
to say, there are two or three crops of silkworms.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, after the cocoons have been formed,
comes the reeling off of the silk, as much
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
as possible before the sleeping grub wakens
and eats its way out, destroying the silk
it has spun for its nest. So again there is
pressure, and again women do the work&mdash;I
never heard of a man reeling silk. It takes
the deft hand and quick eye of a girl to
catch the thread in the boiling water, connect
it with the wheel, and unroll without
breaking the almost invisible thread so wonderfully
wound up by the worm. This work
is often done in the homes, but increasingly
now, because more profitably, in factories
where the girls can be closely watched by
inspectors and paid according to the skill
and the amount of their work.</p>

<p class="indent">The number of families engaged exclusively
in raising silk in the nine principal
districts is reported (1911) at 370,332. In
addition however there are many tens of
thousands of families which make this only
a secondary business. Many merely raise
the worms, selling the cocoons to the factories,
and in such cases the work and strain
are over in a few weeks. The value of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
cocoons raised in 1911 was estimated at
$89,001,988, which gives some idea of the
great importance of this industry to the
families engaged in it. But it must be remembered
that the industry demands heavy
expense and the most taxing of toil while it
lasts.</p>

<p class="indent">As this industry is carried on chiefly in
the homes, the personal conditions of the
workers are relatively favorable, as favorable
as those of the homes. This requires
therefore no special consideration.
</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h2a">WIVES AND DAUGHTERS OF ARTIZANS AND MERCHANTS</p>

<p class="cap">IN old Japan, among the workers the highest
rank was held by farmers, next by
artizans, and last came the merchants, for
they were regarded as resorting to means
somewhat degrading for making their living.
In fact they were not producers of
positive wealth, but lived by cunning wit on
what others had made.</p>

<p class="indent">Artizans, such as carpenters, masons, and
professional weavers, as well as merchants,
naturally live in towns and cities. The first
work of the wife is of course in the home,
but when the husband's work is of such a
nature that it is possible the wife naturally
helps him. Merchants' wives and daughters,
for instance, keep the shops while the husbands
peddle the goods or secure fresh supplies.
Weavers' wives and daughters aid
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
directly, the whole family sharing in the
work and acquiring skill. Carpentry and
masonry however are trades in which women
take no part, so women of these classes also
seek some suitable domestic industry. In
the smaller towns especially, in recent years,
rearing of silkworms is a common occupation
for all classes of moderate means, but
in the cities it is impossible to secure the
necessary mulberry leaves, so straw braiding,
the making of fans, embroidery, and similar
occupations are here sought; and there are
produced the thousand and one articles used
by the middle and wealthy classes and for
export. As a means of increasing the income
the wives of artizans often open their front
rooms as shops and carry on a small retail
business.</p>

<p class="indent">In times of prosperity these classes flourish
and grow luxurious, but hard times occasionally
come, when they are reduced to
dire poverty and even to the verge of starvation;
for, living away from the land, they
are more dependent than farmers on the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
continuous success of their labors and secondary
industries.</p>

<p class="indent">The school education of the women of
these classes is in general the same as that
of the farming class. But inasmuch as they
live, for the most part, in the larger villages,
towns, and cities, they enjoy many advantages
over their farming sisters. Along with
their husbands they have more need of ability
to read and write, and, becoming quick-witted
through the stimulus of city life, they
learn more easily. In recent decades, especially
the last, many of their children, naturally
those of the more successful families,
are pressing up into the higher schools of
learning. As a body, therefore, from the
standpoint of mere intellect and wit, this
class surpasses the farming class. From the
standpoint however of moral character, of
conjugal fidelity, of industry, and of trustworthiness
in all relations the farming class,
along with the shizoku, surpasses all others,
and probably even the peers themselves. But
in these higher classes we must distinguish
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;39]</span>
between the men and the women; for while
the wives are, as a rule, beyond praise in
the matter of conjugal fidelity, the same may
not be said of the husbands.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the many classes of working
women named on a previous page are the
"clerks." This is a new feature of Japanese
life worthy of note, although the class is still
small. Under this name we include ticket
sellers in railway stations, assistant barbers,
and saleswomen and shopgirls. Members of
this class have of course enjoyed a relatively
large amount of education, and are therefore
above the average in general intelligence and
ability. These girls are recruited from the
families of city artizans and merchants.</p>

<p class="indent">The descendants of palanquin bearers, day
laborers, eta, and hi-nin form to-day the
lowest stratum of society, dwelling on the
outskirts of large cities, in wretchedness,
filth, and poverty, getting their living from
day to day and breeding criminals, geisha,
and prostitutes. The stone-breakers, gravel
gatherers, coolies, and most irregular of city
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;40]</span>
day laborers come from this class. Many of
these men have illustrious pedigrees. Some
fell to this estate through wanton lust and
reckless expenditure of inherited wealth;
some are descendants of disinherited sons;
the ancestors of some have met political
reverses and found refuge and safety only
among the "non-humans," where they could
live unrecognized and unknown. Thus all
grades of blood course through the veins of
this, the lowest class in Japan. The wives
and daughters of these men share their fate
and fortune, living from hand to mouth.
Their life is so low and uncertain that it
is absurd to speak of secondary occupations&mdash;they
lack even a primary occupation; and
their homes, which constitute the slums of
the cities, are no places in which to carry
on any domestic industry.</p>

<p class="indent">With the coming to Japan however of
modern industrialism and the building of
large factories in or near the cities, the wives
and daughters of this class have opportunity
for regular work, earning enough and more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
than enough to support themselves while actually
at work. But when attacked by laziness,
fickleness, or disease, they easily slump
back into the same economic pit. From
this lowest class comes one of the serious
dangers threatening the better life of modern
Japan. The insufficiency of these laborers,
their unreliable character, and the
inferior quality of their work, have forced
the factories to search elsewhere for hands.
These they have found in the relatively
workless, but industrious and comparatively
moral farming class. These farmers' girls
have been brought to the cities and thrown
into intimate relations with the lowest, most
dissolute, despised, and really despicable
classes, and the results have naturally been
disastrous in many ways, as we shall see in
a later chapter.

<p class="h2a"><i>KOMORI</i> (BABY-TENDERS)</p>

<p class="cap">THE great poverty of the majority of the
people renders necessary, as already
noted, not only the utmost economy in the
home, but also a high degree of industry,
and the beginning of productive labor at
an early age. As soon as the child has completed
the elementary education, and, in cases
of exceptional poverty, even before that, he
or she must begin to do something of value
and earn a living, at least in part. In the
case of farming families, younger children
care for the youngest and share in the
household duties, thus relieving the mother
and elder children, enabling them to aid
the husband and father in the field. But the
positive agricultural or industrial work which
girls of from ten to fifteen can do is insignificant,
yet they eat as much as a grown
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
person, and hence comes the search for suitable
openings for such workers. This is
found for many of the younger girls in the
homes of the middle and upper classes, where
they go as <i>komori</i> (baby-tenders).</p>

<p class="indent">Girls even as young as ten leave their
homes and go out to service. They receive
food and lodging, in some cases a garment
in summer and one in winter, and sometimes
in addition a small cash stipend. A komori
thus is usually the daughter of a poor family
who goes into a well-to-do family to aid
the mother in the care of her infant. Her
chief duty is to carry the infant, sleeping
or waking, on her back for many consecutive
hours during the day. In addition to
this she aids a little in the household work,
washing dishes and cleaning the house, her
hours of service being unlimited. In some
families she may be called on at any hour
of the night to carry the baby, if it is restless
or fretful and needs to be "jiggled" to
sleep! A komori is employed by the year,
but usually without specific contract, her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
parents sometimes receiving a few yen<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> when
she enters upon service. Her time is entirely
at the disposal of her mistress and she goes
to no school, receives no regular instruction,
and no training other than that which comes
incidentally from association with members
of the family. Long hours each day are spent
on the street with an infant on her back,
playing hop-scotch and other games with
other komori.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">[3]</span>
</a> A yen has the value of forty-nine cents.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In a few places efforts are being made, I
am told, to provide these baby-tenders with
educational advantages, but the movement is
as yet small. Buddhists are said to be particularly
active in this matter.</p>

BABY-TENDERS" /><br />
<span class="caption">CARRYING FAGOTS<br />
BABY-TENDERS</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">A blind man in Matsuyama, a Christian
of my acquaintance, put out one of his daughters
to service as a komori. After two years
of such life, poverty-stricken though the
family was, he brought her home again, for
the child of fourteen, so far from learning
anything good, was learning many things
bad on the street, and was being dwarfed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
in mind by the long hours when she was
wholly without mental stimulus. The life
of a komori will of course vary much with
the nature of the family by which she is employed,
but at best the service cannot fail to
stunt the growth of both body and mind.</p>

<p class="indent">I heard not long since of a boy who became
a komori. His father had died a
drunkard, leaving the family ruined financially.
The mother and children were accordingly
distributed among the creditors to
work off his debts. The little boy of eight
went with his mother, and, so long as she
lived&mdash;some three years&mdash;life was endurable
for him, but after her death he was made
increasingly miserable. Long hours by day
and many interrupted nights, unkind words,
and unutterable loneliness vexed his orphaned
spirit, until he could endure it no
longer, and planned to run away. The stern
master however discovered him doing up
his bundle, and, to prevent his escape, ordered
his few possessions, even his clothing,
to be taken away. In spite of this he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
slipped out one night in the darkness and
hid in a barn in a neighboring village until
morning, when he was taken pity on by some
children who shared a kimono or two with
him, and so he got away. With increasing
years he led a wild, roving life; at eighteen
he became a murderer and was imprisoned
for life, escaping the death penalty on account
of being a minor. In prison he first
heard the Christian gospel of God's forgiving
love, of peace and hope and joy. This
"good news" he accepted, and learned to
read, that he might read the New Testament,
which he committed to memory.
Upon the death of the Empress Dowager, in
1896, his penalty, with that of many other
prisoners, was remitted, and now for fourteen
years he has been living a life remarkably
fruitful in Christian service.</p>

<p class="indent">But, to return to our subject, we note that
not all komori are children. Superannuated
old women who have neither strength nor
brains for anything else also act in this
capacity, their conditions of service and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
wages being the same as those of girls. I
have tried to get some idea as to the number
of komori in Japan, but have been able to
find no statistics. One gentleman assures
me that at least one family in five of the
middle and upper classes employs a komori.
As the number of families in Japan, exclusive
of farmers, is 3,981,940 (1912), this would
make about 796,000 komori; but many well-to-do
farming families also employ komori,
so the total number in Japan would be not
far from 1,000,000. A lady however assures
me that this estimate is altogether too high,
and thinks that not more than one family
in twenty has the means to employ a komori.
If this is true, then the number is in the
vicinity of 250,000. In either case, the system
and its nature are clear, and the numbers
of children sent out to service at a
tender age is not inconsiderable. The attention
of educators and parents is being
directed to the dangers to infants of this
komori system, to say nothing of the harm
it does to the girls themselves.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h2a">HOUSEHOLD DOMESTICS</p>

<p class="cap">BY the time a girl is fifteen or sixteen she
is regarded as sufficiently large, strong,
and mature to enter on more responsible
work. Among the several fields open to her
is that of <i>gejo</i>, or domestic service, of which
we may distinguish two varieties: those who
serve in private families and those who become
maids in hotels and tea-houses. A
komori may gradually work into the position
of a domestic; indeed, in the majority of
homes a komori not only tends the baby but
aids the mother in her household work. It
is only in the homes of the well-to-do that
both gejo and komori are to be found. The
work of a gejo consists in taking the brunt
of the cooking, housecleaning, and washing,
serving from daybreak, that is, from five
or six in the morning, till ten or eleven
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
at night. Her status is somewhat better
than that of the komori. Her hours of
service however are long and taxing. Her
time for rest is after the family has retired
for the night and before they rise in the
morning. Frequently her private room is
the front hall, or entrance room; she accordingly
is the last person to retire and the
first to rise. It is to be noted however that
in the houses of the middle classes in the
large cities there is usually now a small room
for the servant-girl. The gejo draws the
water from the well, washes the rice, lights
the fires, cooks and lives in the dingy and
usually smoky kitchen, washes the clothes,
aids in the sewing, and has no relaxation but
an occasional festival. Her lot is truly
pitiful.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides her living (eating what is left
from the family meal), she usually receives
some two to three yen per month. Recently
however some have been receiving even as
much as five yen. The drudgery and monotony
of the life are usually such that the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
opportunity to become a factory hand is
quickly taken, especially as the cash earnings
are relatively large. I am told by
Japanese ladies that the problem of securing
domestics in the cities or in the vicinities
of factories is becoming serious.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course the average domestic has no
opportunity nor desire for mental improvement.
Having enjoyed no education to speak
of, she can read neither papers nor books,
nor may she attend meetings fitted to cultivate
the mind or promote her higher life.
Thus she is controlled by the culture and
mental and moral traditions of the home in
which she was reared.</p>

<p class="indent">Household domestics are recruited from
farming and industrial families. They earn
their living for from four to six years, until
their parents or guardians find them husbands;
for in Japan the girl has practically
nothing to say as to whom she marries.
Marriage is based, not on mutual acquaintance,
much less on mutual attraction, but
wholly on the judgment of parents or go-betweens,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
and is from first to last&mdash;if it is
proper&mdash;a utilitarian affair.</p>

<p class="indent">It thus comes to pass that in Japan domestics
are, as a rule, young unmarried women.
A domestic in her thirties, or over, is rare,
and is almost certain to be a widow or a divorced
woman.
</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">HOTEL AND TEA-HOUSE GIRLS</p>

<p class="cap">A distinct class of domestics is that
which serves in hotels, tea-houses, and
restaurants. Here the hours of labor are
longer,&mdash;from four or five in the morning
till midnight, or later. My attention was
early called to their hard lot by observing
that the poor girl who was serving rice for
my meal, sitting before me as I ate, often
fell into a sleep, from which I had to awaken
her to get my rice. Inquiry would show
that she had risen at four o'clock that morning,
and further questioning would bring the
information that she had retired the previous
night at midnight or later, sometimes even
not till two o'clock! Rarely do these girls
get five hours of rest; frequently there are
not more than three. They must open all
the <i>amado</i> (sliding wooden shutters which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
protect the paper "windows"), and get the
general cleaning done before the first guest
rises, and must continue their service until
late into the night, answering the calls of
the guests, till the last one has retired. In
addition to the usual cleaning of the rooms,
which is really not much of an undertaking,
these girls carry all the meals of all
the guests from the kitchen on the ground
floor to their rooms on the second or third
floors, serve them while they eat, and carry
away the trays when the meal is completed.
In preparation for the night the girls bring
out the heavy <i>futon</i> (quilts) and make the
"beds" on the floor; and in the morning remove,
fold, and lay them all away in closets.
The work of a Japanese hotel is relatively
heavy for the number of guests, but that
which is most taxing is the long hours of
service and the insufficient time for rest. As
in the poorer homes, so in the poorer and
smaller hotels, the girls have no private
rooms, but sleep in entryways and reception-rooms.
Of course they have neither time nor
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;54]</span>
opportunity for personal culture, nor even
for recreation; and from the nature of their
occupation, is it strange if they sometimes
yield to the solicitations of guests?</p>

<p class="indent">These girls are of course neither professional
prostitutes nor geisha. Yet I was
assured by a provincial chief of police, some
years ago when making investigations, that,
in the eyes of the police, three fourths or
four fifths of the girls in hotels and tea-houses
are virtually prostitutes, though of
course they have no licenses and are subject
to no medical inspection. Occasionally they
are arrested for illegal prostitution, at the
instance however of brothel keepers. Hotels
and tea-houses take pains to secure pretty
girls for servants, in order to make their
service attractive. It is a dreadful statement
to make, but, if I am justified in judging
from such facts as have come to my
knowledge, it would appear that few traveling
men in Japan feel any special hesitation
in taking advantage&mdash;with financial compensation
of course&mdash;of such opportunities as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;55]</span>
are afforded them. Hotels give the girls
their food, perhaps two gowns yearly, and
generally a small payment in cash, but their
principal earnings come from tips. This
makes them attentive to the wants of the
guests.</p>

<p class="indent">There are many first-class hotels throughout
the country, but chiefly in the principal
cities, to which geisha are not admitted, but
in those hotels to which they are admitted
the green country girls soon learn from them
the brazen ways and licentious talk that are
evidently pleasing to many of the guests.
All in all the life and lot of the hotel and tea-house
girl are deplorable indeed. She does
differ from the geisha and licensed prostitute,
however, in that she can leave her place
and retire to her country home at any time,
being held by no contract or debt. Hotel
and tea-house girls are recruited largely from
the families of artizans and small tradespeople,
living in interior towns and villages;
they do not often come from farming families,
since they would lack the regular features
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;56]</span>
and light complexion desired by hotels.
Their family pedigree explains in part this
easy virtue. They are saved from more
disaster than they actually meet, because
geisha and prostitutes abound and are more
attractive.</p>

<p class="indent">I remember, one summer at a little country
hotel, a girl rushed into my room from
a neighbor's in order to escape from the
urgency of a guest. She told me the following
day quite freely of her troubles, of
the horrid men that came to the hotel, and
of the fact that most of the girls did not
mind what she found unendurable. She had
been there but a few weeks and was resolved
to go home as soon as possible, claiming it
was better to starve than to lead such a
hard and especially such a disgusting life.
Realizing that I had an exceptional opportunity
for sociological study, I improved the
occasion and asked many questions. When
asked for her reasons for not responding to
the solicitations of the men, she replied that
it was the fear of being laughed at should
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
she have a child. I could not learn that she
had ever been taught to regard loose sexual
relations before marriage as immoral or as
intrinsically wrong. In her mind the question
had no connection with religion, so far
as I could discover. Her refusal was based
wholly on utilitarian grounds.</p>

<p class="indent">At another hotel where I often stopped I
noticed on one of my tours that an especially
attractive girl of eighteen or nineteen, who
usually waited on me, was no longer there.
On asking her substitute what had become of
her, I was told she had become a regular
prostitute, having found she could earn much
more money that way than at the hotel. I
asked if the parents had not opposed. "O
no!" replied the girl, "the parents were the
ones who proposed it and arranged for it."
I asked the substitute if she herself did not
regard the business as shameful and immoral.
She looked at me with apparent surprise,
hardly understanding what I meant,
evidently regarding the matter entirely as
a financial one.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;58]</span>
Here is another case. A number of Young
Men's Christian Association secretaries,
tramping in the Japanese Alps, were convinced
by the noises one night at the hot
springs that the five or six guides and porters
were indulging in licentiousness. The next
night it came out around the camp-fire that
these guides and porters had paid the hotel
girls five sen<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (two and one-half cents)
each.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">[4]</span>
</a> A sen has the value of one-hundredth of a yen, or almost half a
cent.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Of course one may not generalize from
three cases. But three such cases, together
with the statement of the chief of police, and
the experience, closely corresponding with
my own, of many missionaries who have
traveled in all parts of Japan, are strong
evidence. I myself do not think that guests
often solicit the girls, nor that hotel girls
commonly yield to the requests of guests, but
there can be no doubt that it occasionally
happens, and is not regarded in any such
way by either the men or the women as an
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
Occidental would expect. As said above,
there are many hotels in the cities from
which geisha are rigidly excluded, and
where without doubt the relations of guests
with hotel girls are above criticism.</p>

<p class="indent">It is an impressive fact of Japanese civilization
that the "greenest" country girls can
in but a few short weeks of hotel service become
so graceful and attractive. That in
their lives which to the Occidental is so deep
a sin is nothing to them. Their calm, innocent
eyes, winning ways, and gentle conversation
can hardly fail to impress the foreigner.
But compared with the girls in
their homes they have lost that air of modesty
and reserve which is so important an
element in the charm of Japanese womanhood.
The hotel and tea-house girl belongs
rather to the geisha class, whose loud, harsh
voices and artificial, coarse laughter are distinguishing
characteristics. Girls of both
these classes however have an advantage
enjoyed by no other women in Japan,
namely: that of meeting large numbers of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;60]</span>
men of various occupations and interests.
They hear varied conversation and thus become
somewhat acquainted with the affairs
of the outside world, which makes them more
intelligent than the average Japanese woman,
so that it is possible to carry on some sort
of a conversation with them&mdash;a thing practically
impossible with the average young
woman of Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">In regard to the numbers of hotel domestics,
I have found no statistics, but have no
hesitation in venturing an estimate of many
tens of thousands.
</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h2a">FACTORY GIRLS AND WOMEN</p>

<p class="cap">AS already stated, many girls prefer factory
work to that of domestic service,
either in private families or in hotels. From
ancient times there have been small industrial
enterprises, employing each a few hands
in various lines of work, such as the reeling
and spinning of silk and cotton thread and
the weaving of cloth; but since the war with
China there have arisen enormous factories,
after the fashion of Western lands, which
have introduced great changes in the industrial
situation and in the condition of the
working classes.</p>

<p class="indent">The government report for 1912 shows
that there were 863,447 individuals employed
in 15,119 factories having ten or more hands
each. Of these, 348,230 were men and 515,217
were girls and women. In addition it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span>
reports 427,636 weaving houses, having 733,039
looms and employing 697,698 operators.
No statement is made as to the proportion
of the sexes. Remembering that the government
statistics take no account of industrial
enterprises employing less than ten
hands, it is probably safe to estimate the
number of women employed in exclusively
non-domestic occupations at not less than a
million.</p>

<p class="indent">We are not concerned however with the
industries themselves, but rather with the
conditions under which the operatives work
and the effect of the work on their lives and
characters. To begin with the more pleasant
side of the question, there are factories
which come well up toward the ideal. The
terms of employment, the wages paid, the
provisions for ill health, for accident, for
long service and old age; the rooms for sleeping,
eating, and recreation; the bathing establishments;
the education given to those who
need it; the public lectures and religious and
ethical instruction given at fixed times in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>
public halls of the factories, Buddhist and
Christian teachers being impartially invited;
the provisions for marriage of employees
and arrangements that each couple have a
separate suite of rooms, and that the infants
are cared for while the mother is in the mill;
these and other provisions show that the best
in Japan is up to a high level of excellence.
Such is the policy of the Kanegafuchi Company,
which owns a score of mills in different
parts of Japan, and whose success moreover
is so great that it is now buying up less successful
competitors.</p>

<p class="indent">For several years this company has set
aside annually 20,000 yen ($10,000) for its
relief and pension fund for operatives. In
June, 1913, in addition to its regular appropriation,
it voted an extra $50,000 for a
"welfare promotion fund."</p>

<p class="indent">The president of the Fuji Cotton Spinning
Company was given in 1913 a retiring grant
of $50,000, inasmuch as the great success of
this company had been due to his skill and
energy. He however presented the entire
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
amount to the "employers' relief fund, and
it was decided to make this gift the nucleus
of a permanent endowment fund."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i082" id="i082"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i082.png" alt="AT WORK IN A SILK FACTORY" title="AT WORK IN A SILK FACTORY" /><br />
<span class="caption">AT WORK IN A SILK FACTORY</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">There is a silk factory in Ayabe, the Gunze
Seishi Kwaisha, whose record is the most
wonderful of all. It is managed by a Christian,
who runs it entirely with a view to the
benefit of the workers and the district. No
girls of that district go elsewhere for work.
Once enrolled as members of the working
force they are regularly instructed, both in
general education and in their particular duties;
they earn good wages, keep good health,
receive Christian instruction, have their
regular rest days, remain the full number
of years, help support the family and earn
enough besides to set themselves up in married
life, and are now beginning to send
their daughters to the same factory. This
Christian factory is Christianizing the district.
The rising moral and religious life
is transforming even the agricultural and
other interests of the region. So high is the
grade of silk thread produced, and so uniform
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;65]</span>
and reliable is the quality, that it alone
of all the factories in Japan is able to export
its product direct to the purchasing
firm in the United States, which buys the
entire output at an annual cost of about
$500,000, and without intermediate inspection
at Yokohama. Here we have a splendid
illustration of the way in which Christian
character is solving the problem arising
from the low moral and economic ideals
of the masses of Japan's working classes. As
a rule the modern industrial worker does
not put moral character into his work; and
a wide complaint of Occidental importers
of Japanese products is that goods are not
made according to contract or sample. This
is one of the greatest obstacles to the continuous
prosperity of any Japanese industry;
for as soon as a large demand has arisen
in foreign lands for any given article, its
quality, as a rule, has rapidly deteriorated.
It is this unreliability of Japanese workmen
that makes so difficult direct exportation to
foreign lands without the supervision of Occidental
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span>
middlemen. The Christian Gunze
Seishi Kwaisha is one of the splendid exceptions
which shows what Japanese workmen
and manufacturers can do, when controlled
by high ideals and motives.</p>

<p class="indent">Unfortunately however not all factories
and their managers have the same spirit,
aim, or skill. Many factories are the exact
opposite in every respect to those owned
by the Kanegafuchi and Gunze Seishi companies.
My personal attention was first
called to the heartrending condition of servitude
imposed on vast numbers of girls by
reading, a score of years ago, of a fire in the
dormitory of an Osaka factory. The dormitory
was in a closed compound, whose
doors and gates were carefully locked to keep
the girls from running away. The result
was the death, if I remember correctly, of
every inmate, of whom there were several
score.</p>

<p class="indent"><a name="FmFN09" id="FmFN09"></a>My personal knowledge in regard to the
conditions of life and work of factory operatives
was secured in Matsuyama, Shikoku,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;67]</span>
a small inland city of some forty thousand
inhabitants, having but a single cotton thread
spinning factory. It had no dormitories of
its own, but sent its operatives to certain
specified boarding-houses in the town.
Through a Mr. Omoto, who was at that
time working in the factory, and whose life
story is given in the final chapter, I became
intimately acquainted with the conditions
prevailing in Matsuyama. In 1901, when
Mr. Omoto began to work in the factory,
he was amazed to see how many were the
children taking their turns in work along
with the older girls by day and by night.
Large numbers ranged from seven to twelve
years old, the majority, however, being from
fifteen to twenty. They worked in two
shifts of twelve hours each, but as they were
required to clean up daily they did not get
out till six-thirty or seven, morning and night.
The only holidays for these poor little workers
came two or three times a month, when
the shifts changed; but even then there was
special cleaning, and the girls who had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;68]</span>
worked all night were kept till nine and even
ten in the morning.
<a name="FmFN10" id="FmFN10"></a>He was also deeply
impressed with their wretched condition and
immoral life. The majority of them could
neither read nor write; their popular songs
were indecent, and they were crowded together
in disease-spreading and vermin-breeding,
immoral boarding-houses, where they
were deliberately tempted. Some of the
landlords were also brothel keepers.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Omoto, having opportunity as official
"visitor" to become accurately acquainted
with their life, told me in detail
the conditions which have been briefly summarized
above. The boarding-houses were
only for girls from out of town. They had
to be "recognized" by the factory, and the
girls had to live in the houses to which they
were assigned. Of course the purpose of
these houses was to make money. The financial,
hygienic, intellectual, and moral interests
of the girls were wholly ignored.
They were crowded into ill-ventilated, sunless
rooms, the two shifts occupying the same
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;69]</span>
rooms alternately. Personal extravagance
was purposely stimulated, for girls in debt to
the keepers were compelled to stay to work
off their debts. Drinking and immoral carousings
were their only recreation. As
might be expected, sickness was common and
epidemics frequent. Many girls returned
to their homes after a few months in the
"city" ruined not only in health but in
character,&mdash;premature mothers of illegitimate
children.</p>

<p class="indent">The conditions of the factory girls in
Matsuyama were not unique. Miss J. M.
Holland, a Church of England missionary
in Osaka, recently told me some of her observations
and experiences. She has devoted
the larger part of her time for fifteen years
to work among factory girls, and on the
whole can report improvement. When she
began her visits to the factories, the conditions
were often appalling. It was not uncommon
for girls working on the night shift
to be kept, on one pretext or another, till
noon the next day, making eighteen hours
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;70]</span>
of work. The conditions of work and life
were such that the girls frequently ran away,
to prevent which the dormitories were virtually
prisons within the factory compounds.
The girls were not allowed to go out on
the streets, were given no opportunity for
recreation, and of course no education. They
were underfed, overworked, and punished
in various ways by their overseers, cuffed and
sometimes whipped, for disobedience or blunders.
The daily papers of those days had
frequent items reporting oppression and ill
treatment; to be deprived of wages as punishment
was a common experience; police
occasionally discovered girls working in cellars
and vaults as punishment for misdeeds;
girls sometimes escaped in their night clothes,
and on a few occasions the girls rebelled
and did personal violence to the overseers.</p>

<p class="indent">But, as already stated, the general conditions
are now much better, for it was gradually
found that such ill-treated labor was
not profitable. "Most of the superintendents
in Osaka are now splendid men, who on the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;71]</span>
whole take good care of the girls and wish
to treat them honorably." The crying evils
of the past have been largely done away.
Rest, recreation, education, wages, and health
are receiving careful consideration at all the
leading factories. Still, no true parent would
send a daughter to work in such a place, unless
under the stress of dire poverty. There
are still many small children under ten years
of age, whose parents make false statements
in regard to their ages. The work is from
six in the morning to six in the evening.
This means rising at four-thirty every morning
for work on the day shift. Some factories
have abolished the night shift. Fifteen minutes
are allowed for rest in the middle of the
forenoon, thirty minutes for lunch, and fifteen
minutes again in the afternoon, giving
thus eleven hours of steady work per day
and the same per night. On pay days the
girls, after standing eleven hours, have to
stand in file from one to three hours more, according
to their luck, and Miss Holland says
that such long hours of standing result in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;72]</span>
serious organic difficulties. One half of the
girls fail to work out their three years' contract,
returning to their homes before time
for marriage, seriously injured, if not completely
ruined, physically. So long as this
system continues, she adds, skilled labor is
impossible. While some factories take great
care that girls are carefully guarded from
evil, others exercise no control whatever over
their goings and doings. One factory she
named as allowing its girls to be out on the
streets till two o'clock in the morning. It insists
on only two and a half hours of sleep!
The difficulties connected with private boarding-houses
for factory girls have proved so
great that most of them have been closed.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the tragic aspects of factory life in
Japan is the large number of what would
seem to us avoidable accidents, due to the
fact that the girls know nothing whatever
about machinery. Large factories accordingly
keep surgeons on hand to care for the
wounded. Miss Holland says that in one
Osaka factory where there are a thousand
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;73]</span>
operatives, the kind-hearted surgeon told her
they had an average of fifty accidents daily
which needed his attention. The little children
especially suffer, often losing fingers.
Not long since five fingers were clipped off
in a single day! Miss Holland added that,
improved though the conditions are, factory
life for children is a "murder of the innocents."
As a rule the food provided in factory
dormitories is still inadequate. When
asked whether corporal punishment is still
inflicted, she expressed a doubt, having heard
of none for a long time.</p>

<p class="indent">In her conversation Miss Holland expressly
limited her report to the factories
she knows in Osaka. The question arises
whether the conditions there may not be peculiar.
May not factory conditions in Yokohama
and Tokyo, where government inspection
and control would theoretically be most
complete, be better than elsewhere? The
facts do not seem to justify such a surmise.
The Kanegafuchi Company and some others
have good factories everywhere, but there
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;74]</span>
would seem also to be bad ones everywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">A Japanese book on <i>Industrial Education</i>
has recently been published by a Mr. R.
Uno, who, for fifteen years, has been a devoted
student of Japan's industrial problems.
A summary of the statistics there given
appeared in May, 1914, in the <i>Tokyo Advertiser</i>,
from which I cull the following
facts and figures.</p>

<p class="indent">In the cotton thread and spinning factories
of Japan, there are 81 girls to 19
men. Out of 1,000 girls, 386 are over
20 years of age, 317 are from 17 to 20,
191 are from 15 to 16, 73 are from 12
to 14, while 7 girls out of a thousand are
under 12 years of age. The vast majority
of factory girls live in the factory dormitories,
which are of enormous size. In the
region of Osaka there are more than 30,000
girls working in 30 factories; in these same
factories there are less than 7,000 men.
Three of these factories employ over 3,000
girls each, while three more employ 2,000
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
and upward. These girls are herded together
in enormous dormitories, disastrous
both to health and morals. Statistics covering
a number of years show that out of
every 1,000 girls, 270 work less than six
months at the same place; 200 less than one
year, 179 less than two years; 121 less than
three years; 141 less than five years, and
only 89 pass the five-year period. The usual
reason for this extraordinary fluctuation of
workers is that the girls break down in
health. Government statistics declare that
out of every 100 girls to enter upon factory
work 23 die within one year of their return
to their homes, and of these 50 per
cent. die of tuberculosis. But it is also asserted
that 60 per cent. of the girls who
leave home for factory work never return.
Of the criminal girls arrested in Osaka for
a certain period, 49 per cent. had been factory
hands. As to the education of factory
girls it is stated that, out of 1,000, the number
that had completed the required number
of years of schooling (six) was 450, while
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
385 were entirely without education. Out
of 1,000 girls, 453 were orphans. Of 1,000
girls, 611 came from farmers' homes, 166
from those of fishermen, and 55 from merchant
homes, the remaining 168 being scattering.
Factory girls earn and can save more
than almost any other class. The average
earnings per month are stated to be $4.67.
The girl pays $1.20 per month for food,
which is less than the actual cost, the factory
providing the balance, namely, $1.30. The
average girl sends home fifty cents per
month. Three out of ten girls spend the
balance entirely on clothes, five out of
ten on cakes and theaters, while two out of
ten save it. Such are some of the statements
made by Mr. Uno in his enlightening book.</p>

<p class="indent">In the September, 1910, number of the
<i>Shin Koron</i>, a monthly magazine published
in Tokyo, is an article by Professor Kuwada
(of the Tokyo Imperial University) entitled
"The Pitiful Environment of Factory
Girls." He gives a detailed statement of the
conditions of factory workers, in which he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
estimates the number of female laborers in
factories containing ten or more hands at
700,000, of whom ten per cent. are under
fourteen years of age. In tobacco factories
ten per cent., in match factories twenty per
cent, and in glass factories thirty per cent.
of the girls are under ten years of age. He
vigorously condemns the situation as threatening
the future of the working class, whose
prospective mothers are thus being destroyed.
The efforts of the government during recent
years to enact factory laws have been successfully
thwarted thus far, says Professor Kuwada,
by shortsighted, selfish capitalists. The
girls are brought in from their country homes
by false promises. They are told of the
beautiful sights to be seen, theaters to be
visited, the regular Sunday rest, and even
of the splendid care and education they will
receive from the factory. There is also
stealing of expert workers from one factory
by the artful stratagems of another. There
are factories which resort to devices for defrauding
helpless operatives. In one town
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
where there are many factories, it is customary
to work overtime by setting back
the hands of the clock. To conceal this from
the operatives, no factory blows its whistles!
Some factories do not give time for the girls
to rest even while they eat, but require them
to work with the right hand while they eat
with the left. Night work in which both
male and female operatives are engaged together
is most demoralizing. Punishment of
various kinds is administered. In addition
to fines, in some places the girls are imprisoned
in dark rooms, rations are reduced,
their arms are bound and the lash applied
freely, and in extreme cases they are stripped
to the waist and marched through the factory
among young men and girls, bearing a red
flag tied to the back! Superintendents are
invariably men.</p>

<p class="indent">So appalling was the statement made by
Professor Kuwada that I could scarcely believe
him in all the details, particularly in
regard to the use of the lash and the stripping
to the waist. I accordingly wrote both
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
to him and to Professor Abe of Waseda University,
who has made special study of the
social problems and conditions of industry.
Professor Kuwada, I learned, has been a
careful student of social and industrial conditions
for nearly twenty years, and is one
of the leaders in the Society for the Study
of Social Politics, composed of one hundred
and fifty university professors and high government
officials. This society was organized
to aid the government in its efforts to secure
social and industrial reforms. In reply to
my inquiries Professor Kuwada says that
most of the facts given concerning silk factories
he has himself observed. Those concerning
cotton spinning factories he has derived
from reliable sources, chiefly from the
officers of the Department of Agriculture and
Commerce, who are especially engaged in
making investigations in regard to industrial
conditions. Much of the testimony rests on
the statements of the girls themselves. Some
of the facts come from local police and some
from the published reports of the Department
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;80]</span>
of Agriculture and Commerce. "The
article in the <i>Shin Koron</i> may therefore be
regarded as semi-official," says Professor
Abe. Since the appearance of the article referred
to above, no reply has been made to
it by factory owners or managers. As to
the stripping of a girl to the waist and marching
her through the factory filled with
operatives, male and female, Professor Kuwada
was told this by the girl herself. Under
such circumstances, it is difficult to doubt
the testimony. Nor is it probable that the
cases cited are absolutely unique, although
I think it highly probable that such extreme
indignities and punishments are rare,&mdash;they
are so out of keeping with the whole trend
of Japanese civilization and culture. Mrs.
Binford, a missionary in Mito, assures me,
however, that altering the hands of the clock
is a practise known to her. Testimony is
widespread that girls are secured for factories
by all kinds of false statements.</p>

<p class="indent">In view of the frightful conditions of industrial
labor thus indicated by Mr. Uno and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
Professor Kuwada, it is amazing that the
Diet has refused on several successive occasions
to enact suitable laws. The government
began to realize in 1898 the need for legislation
on these matters. A bill which was
drafted and presented in 1902 was rejected,
as were also three subsequent bills. The
chief feature of the bill presented during
the winter of 1910-11 was the provision
that no factory may employ girls under
twelve, and that girls of any age and youth
under sixteen may not be kept at work for
more than twelve hours per day, nor be made
to do night work without "special reason."
While some provisions of this bill were enacted
and others amended, those considered
most important by social reformers and by
the government were virtually rejected. The
bill was indeed passed, but with the added
provision that the important clauses, relative
to ages and night work, be inoperative for a
period of fifteen years (!) in order to give
time to the factories involved to adjust themselves
to the new conditions. Since that time
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;82]</span>
no further factory legislation has been enacted.
Is it not astounding that in a land on
the whole so progressive as Japan the difficulty
of securing reform should be found in
the Diet? The administration at this point
is ahead of the representatives of the people,
as it is indeed in many other respects. The
fact is, as Professor Kuwada points out, that
the "representatives" in both the lower and
upper houses represent the financial interests
of capitalists, rather than the human
interests of the masses.</p>

<p class="indent">But the reader, in his indignation over the
situation of factory workers in Japan, should
remember that Japan is no exceptional sinner
among the nations. Christian England
and America have had conditions equally
bad, and possibly worse. Dr. Washington
Gladden, in his article on "The Reason for
the Unions," in the New York <i>Outlook</i> for
March, 1911, makes the following statements
in regard to the condition of labor in England
in the early part of the nineteenth century.
Men and women stood daily at their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
tasks, from twelve to fourteen and fifteen
hours; a working day of sixteen hours was
not an unheard-of thing. Government reports
of this period show that children of
five and six years of age were frequently
employed in factories. "Nor was this unmeasured
abuse of child labor confined to
the cotton, silk, and wool industries....
The report of 1842 is crammed with statements
as to the fearful overwork of girls
and boys in iron and coal mines, which doubtless
had been going on from the end of the
eighteenth century;... Children could get
about where horses and mules could not.
Little girls were forced to carry heavy
buckets of coal up high ladders, and little
girls and boys instead of animals dragged
the coal bunkers. Women were constantly
employed underground at the filthiest tasks.
Through all this period the wages gravitated
downward and family income was steadily
lowered, while the cost of food increased.
The homes of the workers were ruined. In
a certain congested district there lived 26,830
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span>
persons in 5,366 families, three fourths of
which possessed but one room each. The
rooms were without furniture, without everything;
two married couples often shared the
same room. In some cases there was not
even a heap of straw on which to sleep. In
one cellar the pastor found two families and
a donkey; two of the children had died and
the third was dying." And these conditions
existed, not in days of industrial depression,
but in flush times; business was booming and
wealth accumulating in the hands of factory
owners and employers.</p>

<p class="indent">Many of the conditions of industrial workers
even in the United States to-day are heartrending
in the extreme. Who could read
of the strike of the shirt-waist makers of
New York in the winter of 1909-10 without
deep indignation over the conditions under
which those brave girls worked, and against
which they rebelled? The National Committee
on Child Labor reported in the spring
of 1911 that there were over 60,000 children
in the factories of the United States, mostly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
in the South. Before condemning Japan
unduly, Occidentals should remember that
their own record is none too bright.</p>

<p class="indent">If comparison is to be made however
between Japan and the West, it may be made
along other lines. The West fell into its
industrial difficulties with no example from
which to learn. But this is not true of Japan.
She can easily learn the lesson of a century
of Western experience; but she seems slow
to do it. Then again in Japan it is the
government that is feebly leading, and the
official popular representatives who are both
blind and resisting, whereas in the West the
great movements for industrial reform are
movements of the people themselves, backed
up and oftentimes led by enlightened humanitarian
and Christian popular opinion.
In the West, the churches are fairly in line
with forward social movements, whereas in
Japan, Shintoism, Confucianism, and even
Buddhism are apparently wholly indifferent
to the economic and even ethical condition of
the nation's toilers. Furthermore, we are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
seeing to-day in Japan the strange phenomenon
of one section of the government seeking
to ameliorate social and economic conditions,
and at the same time another, seemingly mortally
afraid of allowing the people either
to discuss these matters or to attempt reform
movements themselves. Labor unions are
strictly forbidden, and any person advocating
socialism is under strict police surveillance.
Strikes are illegal and their promoters are
liable to criminal punishment. Anomalous
as it may be, the government seems to be
seeking to destroy that enlightened popular
opinion on which it must rely for the efficient
enforcement of its own plans for social
betterment of the working classes.</p>

<p class="indent">I have dwelt at considerable length on
the conditions of factory workers, for later
on I shall describe a sociological experiment
among this class.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h2a">GEISHA (HETÆRÆ)</p>

<p class="cap">THE word <i>geisha</i> means an "accomplished
person." A geisha is invariably
a young woman who has had years of training
fitting her to provide social entertainment
for men. The <i>gei</i> acquired are skill in
playing the samisen (a three-stringed guitar),
singing catching ditties, taking part in conversation
and repartee, and in "dancing,"
which is to the Western mind rather a highly
conventional posturing, with deft manipulations
of the inevitable fan. Years of exacting
and diligent work are required for
proficiency in these "gei,"&mdash;the Geisha
School in Kyoto provides a course of six or
seven years.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i092" id="i092"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i092.png" alt="O HAMAYU (GEISHA)
Most celebrated in Tokyo" title="O HAMAYU (GEISHA)
Most celebrated in Tokyo" /><br />
<span class="caption">O HAMAYU (GEISHA)<br />
Most celebrated in Tokyo</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">According to the Japanese ideal, geisha
singing must be shrill, and to secure this
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
quality the voice is purposely strained till
it is "cracked." Girls eight to ten years old
are sometimes given their "singing lessons"
in the frosty air of winter mornings before
sunrise, or late at night, in order that they
may take cold in the throat and then, by persistent,
vigorous use, the voice is "broken"
for life. Training in dancing and samisen
playing is also prolonged and severe, for no
pains are spared in efforts to excel. These
efforts however are due, not to the will or
desire of the <i>maiko</i>, the poor little girl who
is being trained, but to the persistence of her
owner.</p>

<p class="indent">Only daughters of the very poor are secured
for this outwardly beautiful and attractive,
but inwardly repulsive, soul-destroying life.
Practically speaking, geisha are
the property of the old women who support
and educate them through the years of their
childhood, and who rent them out by the
hour for the entertainment of men at social
functions. Such functions would, indeed, be
inane without geisha to serve the meals in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
their dainty ways, to fill the sake<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> cups for
guests, to share in conversation by adding the
spice, to provoke laughter, themselves laughing
loudly and often, and at the proper time,
to present their music, their singing, and
their dancing. Dressed in faultless style, in
richest silks and brilliant colors, geisha are
moving pictures which have charmed generations
of Japanese men and, in recent decades,
many foreigners. Japanese political party
dinners and consultations are often held in
restaurants, where geisha make the fun and
pour the wine. If foreign guests are to be
entertained by wealthy individuals, by companies,
or even by cities, the inevitable geisha
is there, and is presented as a characteristic
product of Japan&mdash;which she truly is. But
while there is about her a certain charm of
manner and dress, to one who watches her
face, looking for traces of a soul, the story
is all too plain&mdash;behind the harsh laugh and
stoical face it is impossible not to recognize
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
that there is an empty and often a bleeding
heart.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The lives of these girls are pitiful in the
extreme. Chosen from among the families
of the poor on the basis of their prospective
good looks and ability to learn, they leave
their homes at an early age and are subjected
to the severe drill already outlined.
They go through their lessons with rigid,
mechanical accuracy. In public they appear
in gorgeous robes, their faces painted and
powdered, artificiality dominating everything
about them,&mdash;clothing, manners, and smiles.
As a rule nothing is done to develop their
minds, and of course the cultivation of personal
character is not even thought of. They
are instructed in flippant conversation and
pungent retort, that they may converse interestingly
with the men, for whose entertainment
they are alone designed. The songs
learned, some of the dances performed, and
the conversational repertoire acquired are
commonly reported to be highly licentious,
but these are the gei that best please the men,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
to whom they are open for private engagements
from the time they are eighteen years
of age. If, however, a geisha is exceptionally
beautiful, her owner does not allow her to
enter on such duties, for experience has shown
that her beauty is soon lost in this way, and
with it her highest earning capacity.</p>

<p class="indent">Many geisha undoubtedly develop considerable
personal ability. The severe drill undergone
could hardly fail to call forth their
powers of mind, and intimate association
with educated and quasi-cultured men serves
further to stimulate their mental faculties.
In native ability too they are not lacking,
though drawn from the lowest classes of society,
for, as will soon be more fully explained,
they sometimes possess strains of
high lineage. The national custom, which
represses the normal intellectual development
and social instincts of cultured, respectable
women, is removed from this one class, which
is favored by many circumstances. They are
not subjected to the debauching excesses usual
with the ordinary prostitute, nor to humiliating
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;92]</span>
medical inspection. They are not conscious
of popular disapproval, but on the
contrary are the beauties of the town, their
photographs for sale on every street. Indeed
one well-informed gentleman told me that
probably ten per cent. of the geisha enter
the calling by their own choice. No wonder
that from time to time the tale is told of
some Japanese man of social position falling
under the spell of an accomplished geisha,
whom he prefers to any of the silent, passive,
timid, incompetent girls selected for
him, who in all probability have never talked
with any man except immediate relatives or
tradesmen. The national custom which predetermines
the social incompetence of the
majority of cultured women compensates for
the loss by providing this geisha class. Not
until Japanese ladies can hold their own in
social life will the vocation of the geisha be
ended.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the surprises one meets in studying
the geisha question is the fact that not
a few of the girls have features which indicate
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;93]</span>
distinguished ancestry. My explanation
for this fact is the further fact that for
ages the standards of moral life in Japan
have allowed large freedom of sexual relations.
The result is that in the lowest classes,
from which geisha are recruited, there run
strains of gentle blood. It thus comes to
pass that now in the midst of coarse surroundings
and in deep poverty there are born
of parents manifestly belonging to the lowest
class, children of exceptional beauty,
fitted, so far as individual appearance indicates,
to belong to the highest ranks of society.
Whether or not this suggested explanation
is correct as a matter of historic
fact I am not able to say, but I offer it as
the most plausible that has occurred to me.</p>

<p class="indent">Parents in this class of society much prefer
daughters to sons, for they are likely to
become valuable sources of income. At eight
or nine, those destined for the "accomplished"
calling are put into the care of some
experienced geisha and a mutual contract is
given for a specific period (five or six years),
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span>
during which the child is termed a <i>maiko</i>
(dancing girl). As a rule the parents receive
a small sum at the beginning of this
first period. The owner undertakes to support
and train the girl, and expects to profit
by her earnings. By the time the girl is
fifteen or sixteen she has finished her apprenticeship,
when, if she has exceptional graces
and charms likely to win her a place in
the highest social gatherings, she will secure
quite a competency (many hundreds of yen,
and in some cases even a few thousand) for
the keeper and parents. On the expiration
of the first contract a new one is made, and
so on, until the girl has passed her prime and
is no longer sought for entertainments. If
in the interval she has not become the concubine
of some rich man, she then either returns
to her poor home or, what is more
usual, becomes a servant in a hotel or tea-house.
If her ability is exceptional, she may
set up as geisha keeper, train other maiko,
employ younger geisha, and so make her
living.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;95]</span>
The great ambition of a geisha is to
"catch" some wealthy man of rank with
her charms and become his concubine. My
informant estimates that this is what happens
to perhaps one half of the geisha. In
such cases the man pays down a handsome
sum to the owner, who sends part of it to
the parents. Thus he buys his concubine,
whom he usually keeps in a villa, not his
home. I have asked if geisha ever become
true, legal wives and am told "only very
rarely." But, if they do, are they cordially
received by the man's kindred? "Oh, no!
that is not possible," is the repeated answer.
The effects of her training can never be obliterated,
and the new relatives cannot forget
the despicable class from which she comes,
and the calling by which she has gained her
husband. She may become indeed refined
and altogether correct in manner, but the
taint of her origin as a rule adheres to her.
Then too the years of immoral life before
she won her husband make it a rare thing
for a geisha to have children, and childless
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;96]</span>
wives in Japan are not at a premium, for the
prime purpose of marriage is the maintenance
of the family line.</p>

<p class="indent">Foreigners commonly say that geisha are
not prostitutes. It is true they are not licensed,
that is to say, professional, prostitutes
in the eye of the law, nor are they
procurable, as are regular prostitutes, by the
average man, for the expense is too great.
But the chief of police already referred to,
and many Japanese of whom I have inquired,
insist that a large proportion of geisha are
corrupt&mdash;two geisha keepers have estimated
the proportion as high as ninety per cent.
Geisha who decline engagements leading to
immorality are rare indeed, and for that very
reason are unpopular.</p>

<p class="indent">But better than generalized statements is
the story of an actual life. There lives to-day
in Hyogo a paralytic whose influence
through her words, newspaper articles, and
books is widely felt throughout central Japan.
She is one of the few girls who, though
trained as a geisha, refused to follow the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;97]</span>
calling. The story of her life is worthy of
more than passing mention.</p>

<p class="indent">Her father died in her infancy, and shortly
after the death of her mother, who had married,
her stepfather likewise married again.
These stepparents, deciding to have her become
a geisha, expended much time and
money on her training.</p>

<p class="indent">When she was prepared at sixteen years
of age, she was entrusted to a woman whose
business it was to find employment for geisha
in hotels and tea-houses. This woman took
her to a house in Osaka, where there were
already many geisha and regular prostitutes.
Learning the nature of the duties expected
of her, she positively refused to comply. In
spite of the fact that it was twenty miles
to her home and that there were but two sen
in her pocket, she escaped from the hotel,
spent one sen on bridge toll, one sen on a
lunch, and succeeded in walking all that distance
alone, reaching home after midnight,
the home from which she had been sent out
with hopes that she should win for her stepparents
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span>
an ample support. The reception accorded
her can be fancied. She held firmly
however to her resolve, preferring poverty
and hard toil to luxury and fine clothing
along with that service on which these were
conditioned. Work was found for her in a
factory, then as a family servant, and finally
at a small tea-house, where during the winter
she was especially exposed to the cold.
An attack of rheumatism developed into paralysis.
With no hope of recovery she longed
for death, for her stepparents, considering
the case hopeless, neglected to care for her
properly, although she was so helpless. She
could not feed herself, nor even crawl to the
well in which she wished to drown herself,&mdash;the
final resource of many a despairing Japanese
woman. But, by a strange series of
circumstances, or should we not say by a
merciful Providence? a Christian man discovered
and befriended her, told the story
of Jesus, and revealed the Savior. Her faith
soon became so strong and her words proved
so thoughtful and helpful to those Christian
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
friends who came to see her, that her influence
began to spread. She found she could
manage to write with her crippled hand, and
as what she wrote was like her spoken words,
simple and strong, it soon found its way into
print. She was finally led to write the story
of her life, and this book, with other articles
written by her, has afforded a small income,
which with additional help from friends has
secured a comfortable home for herself and
the family of which she is now the center.
Her name is Zako Aiko, and she lives in
Hyogo.</p>

<p class="indent">A few geisha, coming under Christian influences,
have been converted, and so far as
I know, such persons leave the calling altogether,
as incompatible with Christian principles.
But condemnation of the whole
geisha system is not confined to Christians.
Many Japanese, entirely outside our Christian
circles, regard it as a disgrace to the
country, and wish the whole business, along
with licensed prostitution, concealed from
public view. For instance, a man of high
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;100]</span>
official rank, president of a large institution,
tells me he regrets that there is no first-class
Japanese hotel in Kyoto at which he may entertain
foreign guests in Japanese style, except
where geisha serve the meals. Rather than
countenance the geisha system, he prefers to
take his guests to a hotel where the service
is not so perfect but where the women employed
are above suspicion. He deplored the
fact one day that all foreigners coming to
Kyoto in the spring visit the <i>Miyako odori</i>,
commonly known in English as the "Cherry
Dance." I myself have seen this performance
more than once, and found nothing objectionable
in either the so-called dancing,
its setting, or its accompaniments. It nevertheless
affords opportunity for the display
of something like eighty or ninety geisha,
and helps to maintain the business and the
system. As indicating the status of geisha
in the best Japanese society, it is significant
that all geisha are rigidly excluded from
every entertainment where any member of
the Imperial household is present.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;101]</span>
It is often said by foreigners that geisha
and prostitutes not infrequently make happy
matches, and by legal marriage escape from
their unhappy lives of shame. This is one
of those pretty fables one would like to
believe, but the facts do not seem to support
the theory. There are, no doubt, rare instances
where such has been the case. I
have known two women who had been geisha
and who married men of some position. In
one case the man was a physician. When
I knew the family the ex-geisha had been in
the home a number of years and was a lovely,
modest, capable woman, a regular member
of my wife's cooking class. But it was noticeable
that she always took a "back seat"
among the ladies; she was tolerated by them
and treated not unkindly, but it was clear
that they looked down on her. The man's
kindred never favored the match, and would
not let him marry the woman legally, so she
lived in his house, took excellent care of his
first wife's children, and was to them all that
a stepmother could be, yet, so far as I know,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;102]</span>
she has never gained her full position in
the home of her husband nor among his
relatives.</p>

<p class="indent">The other case I knew but slightly, as she
died but a few weeks after I made her acquaintance,
but she must have been a woman
of exceptional character. She was a Christian
and highly respected in the church.</p>

<p class="indent">Such cases, however, are rare. A geisha
may be in high favor during the decade or
more when at the height of her physical
charms, though even then her inner life is
empty and loveless; but when no longer attractive
she is cast aside as a faded flower,
to spend the rest of her life forlorn, unloved,
and uncared for. Truly, the way of the
geisha is hard!</p>

<p class="margin-left8">
Geisha naru mi to;<br />
Michi tobu tori wa<br />
Doko no idzuko de<br />
Hateru yara,
</p>

<p>is a popular ditty regarding the final disappearance
of geisha from sight. It may be
roughly translated: "What becomes of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;103]</span>
geisha, do you ask? I ask in turn, where end
their lives the birds that fly along the
road?"</p>

<p class="indent">In regard to the number of geisha, Mr.
Murphy's statistics show that from 1887 to
1897 they increased throughout Japan from
10,326 to 26,536, and since then the increase
has been relatively small, the number
being now in the vicinity of 30,000.</p>

<p class="indent">So far as is known to me, no regular Christian
or philanthropic work is done for this
class.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h2a"><i>SHOGI</i> (LICENSED PROSTITUTES)</p>

<p class="cap">IT may seem strange to class prostitutes
among working women, but the facts require
such classification, for, not only so far
as the parents and brothel keepers are concerned,
but also so far as the girls themselves
are concerned, it is entirely a matter of
money. If the business did not pay splendidly,
the keepers would not erect their
handsome buildings, pay the heavy license
fees, nor buy the girls from the parents at
considerable cost. And on the other hand,
if the parents did not receive what they
regard as large sums for their daughters,
the latter would not be sold to such lives
of shame and disease. And so far as the
poor victims are concerned, there is abundant
evidence that they often go into the
wretched business solely at the command of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;105]</span>
their parents, for among the lowest class the
noble doctrine of obedience to parents is
shamefully perverted to this vile end. Children
are taught that obedience is a child's
first duty, regardless of the question whether
the thing required by parents is right or
wrong. The girl goes to the brothel in
obedience to her parents, who send her there
to earn a living for herself and to help them
out of special financial difficulties. Thus
from first to last, so far as the girls, the
parents, and the keepers are concerned, the
question is economic.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the working women of Japan prostitutes
surely are the most pitiful of all.
They give the most and get the least. They
receive no training, like the geisha; have no
liberty; to prevent their running away, are
imprisoned in brothels, or if diseased or ill,
in hospitals; and have no friends except possibly
other prostitutes. Most of them soon
loathe the business, but are helpless, hopeless
prisoners,&mdash;for the keepers who paid
their parents a few score or hundreds of yen
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
and loaded them with beautiful clothes,
charge all these items to their account, so
that they are under a heavy debt which
must be paid before they can leave. This
debt the laws of the land theoretically ignore
but practically recognize, for the
"keeper" keeps the books as well as the
brothel, and the police and officials are often
on his side. In this way licentiously inclined
officials, merchants, and travelers provide
for the easy, economical, and legal satisfaction
of their desires.</p>

<p class="indent">I do not propose here to give a detailed
account of this distressful and disgusting
"business." Those who desire more information
should procure <i>The Social Evil in
Japan</i>, by the Rev. U. G. Murphy. Some
years ago Mr. Murphy, by grit and pluck,
carried certain test cases through the courts
and secured legal opportunity for girls to
quit the business if they wished. The Salvation
Army and some of the daily papers
took pains to let the brothel girls know their
legal rights, and in a short period over
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
twelve thousand, at that time over one third
of the whole number, left the brothels, so
that for a while the business was prostrated
in many quarters. This single fact shows the
spirit and attitude of a large number of the
girls. Since then the wily keepers and all
interested in maintaining this lucrative trade
have succeeded in modifying the administration
of the regulations, so that the girls are
again closely controlled.</p>

<p class="indent">There is however a rising public conscience
and an abolition movement is gathering
strength. The virtual slavery of the
girls; the fact that they are openly bought
and sold, and that, too, under governmental
supervision and sanction; the cruelty inflicted
on many girls by their keepers; the fraud
practised in connection with their accounts,
whereby a girl is kept hopelessly in debt, so
that, however faithful she may be, release is
impossible, and indeed the more faithful the
more profitable she is to her keeper&mdash;all
these facts are becoming widely known and
are beginning to arouse public indignation.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;108]</span>
The government is openly charged with protecting
slavery, and that of the worst kind.
High government officials are being condemned
for licentiousness.</p>

<p class="indent">As signs of the times, I give a few facts.
In the summer of 1909 the wealthiest and
most centrally located prostitute quarter in
Osaka was completely wiped out by a great
fire. Before the flames were fully out, the
anti-brothel forces realized their opportunity
and under the leadership of the Young Men's
Christian Association and Young Women's
Christian Union began to agitate for refusal
to allow the rebuilding of the business
in that region of the city. A petition was
prepared and signed by one hundred thousand
people. Large numbers of Osaka's best
citizens allied themselves with the movement.
The result was that the authorities in charge
saw fit to yield to the pressure and arranged
that the new buildings for prostitution should
be erected on the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p class="indent">In the winter of 1911, the city of Tokyo
suffered from a great conflagration which
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;109]</span>
completely destroyed the section of the city
known as "Yoshiwara,"<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which for three
hundred years has been assigned to prostitution.
This center of the social evil had
become enormously wealthy, and such magnificent
buildings had been erected for the
business that it had become one of the famous
sights of Tokyo. Before the fire was
fairly over, the anti-brothel forces began
to organize their campaign, which continued
for months. A magazine called <i>Purity</i>
(<i>Kaku Sei</i>) was started. In this case, however,
success did not crown their efforts.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_6" id="Footnote_1_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_6"><span class="label">[6]</span>
</a> Foreigners commonly, but mistakenly, suppose that "Yoshiwara" means
"Prostitute Quarter."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Not long since an army division was located
in the vicinity of Wakayama, a city
of considerable importance, not far from
Osaka, in which there have never been any
prostitute houses. This led to the suggestion
that it would be well to open there a regular
prostitute quarter. The matter was
keenly discussed and the proposition carried
through the city council and authorized by
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span>
all the lower officials, but when it came
finally before the prefectural governor for
signature, it was vetoed, and the veto message
is worthy of preservation and careful
consideration by those who are interested in
these matters.</p>

<p class="indent">The governor says in his message: "I was
early convinced that the establishment of
licensed quarters in the city was harmful
to the public interest. It has been a subject
of discussion in Wakayama now for many
years, and I have investigated the question
thoroughly from the standpoint of public
morals, health, and economics, at places with
and without licensed quarters, and find that
the existence of such institutions is distinctly
harmful. The standard of morals is lowered,
the public health impaired, disease
made rampant, the young are sent into wrong
channels, homes are broken up, and extravagance
is encouraged. The state of affairs
in Shingu, in this prefecture of Wakayama,
where licensed houses have been established,
clearly shows that the existence of such
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>
places is extremely harmful to public interest.
The majority representation to the
authorities urged the establishment of licensed
quarters on the ground that the quarters
would promote the prosperity of that
section of the city in which they were situated.
It is true they may benefit a section
of the city in one way, but the benefit so
obtained would be offset by many other evils.
The military authorities are strongly opposed
to the establishment of licensed quarters,
and their views are very reasonable.
For these reasons I have decided to refuse
permission for the establishment of licensed
quarters in Wakayama city."<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In passing, it is worthy of record that the
prefecture of Joshu has for over thirty years,
by ceaseless vigilance, prevented government
sanction of prostitution. Repeatedly has the
battle been fought and repeatedly have the
anti-brothel forces won. In this respect
Joshu stands alone among the forty-eight prefectures
of the Japanese empire.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span>
As illustrating the low moral ideals prevailing
among a certain class of men, Professor
Abe of Waseda University, in a recent
brothel-abolition speech, told of a certain
politician who, though a fast liver, was
praised because he never debauched the
wives and daughters of his friends, but always
confined himself to those women whose
services he fully paid for in hard cash!
Colonel Yamamuro, the highest Japanese
officer in the Salvation Army, on the same
evening, speaking of the low moral ideals
of the classes from which prostitutes are
drawn, said that in connection with the Salvation
Army he had had opportunity to
know of twelve hundred girls who had been
aided in the two rescue homes of the Army.
Of these twelve hundred about one half had
been prostitutes. The reasons given by them
for leaving were various, such as ill health,
cruelty, lovers, but not one said she left
the business because it was wrong. The evidence
is full and convincing that a considerable
section of the Japanese people do not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;113]</span>
regard loose sexual relations as particularly
immoral.</p>

<p class="indent">In regard to the statistics of prostitutes,
the figures given by Mr. Murphy are probably
the most accurate available, and are
substantially official. Between 1887 and
1897 the number of prostitutes increased
from 27,559 to 47,055, reaching their maximum
in 1899, when there were 52,410. Then,
following up the work of Mr. Murphy and
the Salvation Army, came the "cessation
movement," reducing the number to 40,195
in 1901, and the following year to 38,676.
Since that date the number has grown. In
two years four thousand fresh girls were
bought up, and a thousand more the following
year. The latest statistics are those
for 1906, when the number of prostitutes
was reported as 44,542. It is safe to say
that at the present time the number is near,
if it has not passed, the fifty thousand
mark.</p>

<p class="indent">It would be natural to suppose that recruits
for the geisha and shogi occupations
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;114]</span>
would be found largely among the poorest
farmers, but both my outdoor man and also
my cook assert that such is not the fact.
"Farmers would never sell their daughters
for such vile purposes, however poor they
might become. Parents who do such things
are only the degenerate creatures who live
in cities," is the scornful remark of my gardener.
My cook asserts the same thing, and
adds that farmers' daughters have not the
genteel features and figures nor the light
complexion essential to girls seeking such
occupations. Other investigations confirm
these assertions. The great cities of Nagoya
and Niigata, and indeed the whole of Echigo,
are famous for the supply of girls they send
to the brothels of Tokyo. A poor man with
several daughters has a pretty good investment,
and rejoices more at the birth of a girl
than of a boy, because it means an early and
definite income.</p>

<p class="indent">I found at one time in Matsuyama that
all the girls of sixteen to eighteen years of
age in a certain poor quarter had, in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;115]</span>
course of one year, been sold off to the
brothels. About that time a man came to
me with a pitiful story of poverty; he had
five children, but unfortunately they were
all boys; had they been girls, he said, he
might have sold some of them and so not
have needed to ask my aid!</p>

<p class="indent">The word used in connection with both
geisha and prostitutes is perfectly frank;
no effort is made to conceal by terms the
nature of the transaction. The girls are
"bought" and "sold." They employ the
same words as those used in buying and selling
animals, food, clothing&mdash;anything. Their
purchase and sale is a regular business in
which men and women openly engage, traveling
the country over in search of girls, and
conducting them in small groups to the keepers
of brothels, who pay so much a head.
And this takes place in civilized Japan!
Moreover, in spite of the fact that girls may
thus be bought, it is true that they are also
occasionally stolen. I have known of a
pitiful instance where the girl, a member of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;116]</span>
a respectable family, was boxed and shipped
on a steamer as freight, to elude the police,
and taken to Siam. In five years she has
succeeded in getting one letter to her home,
but the parents dare not put the matter into
the hands of Japanese officials, as that would
make the situation hopeless.</p>

<p class="indent">But Occidentals may not forget how terrible
a scourge is commercialized vice in
civilized and so-called "Christian" Europe,
and who has not heard of the "white slavery"
of America, with its stealing of girls
and young women for purposes of prostitution?
The institution of comparisons between
nations and individuals is alike odious,&mdash;but
unavoidable. A fair comparison would
seem to be that, whereas in the West the
moral sense of a large proportion of the
people is very strongly against the social
evil and seeks to abolish it, in Japan the
moral sense of the mass of the population
acquiesces in the situation, so that the government
and a vast majority of the influential
people of the land unite to make the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;117]</span>
business safe, legal, and remunerative; and
that, while in Occidental Christian lands
no girl can voluntarily enter this sphere of
life without being conscious of its shame
and immorality, many of the girls of Japan
may have no adequate knowledge of these
inevitable consequences until their fate has
been sealed.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h2a">AMELIORATIVE EFFORTS</p>

<p class="cap">THE reader will desire to know what, if
any, have been the efforts to ameliorate
the evils described in preceding pages. They
are of two kinds: first, governmental in
origin, general in scope, legal and educative
in method; and second, private in origin,
both general and specific in scope, personal,
educative, ethical, and religious in method.</p>

<p class="indent">The general educational policy of the government
is not to be regarded as a philanthropic
or ameliorative effort to meet the
conditions already described. This policy
however does have a powerful elevating influence
on the lives and character of the
entire people. As we have seen, over ninety-seven
per cent. of the girls of school age
are in attendance, according to the reports.
Though we allow a discount on these figures
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;119]</span>
(and some may perhaps be necessary),
we can still say that, if the present policy
of six years of compulsory education is carried
out, the rising generation of boys and
girls will be able to read fairly well the
daily paper and simple books. To millions
of women this means the opening of doors
of knowledge and opportunity which in ages
past have been closed to them.</p>

<p class="indent">The government has also been the chief
initiative force in all recent movements
to improve the economic and industrial conditions
of the people. Railroads in Japan
owe their existence to the government, as
also do many forms of modern industry.
Agriculture and fruit and stock raising owe
much to the government, which has imported
Western seed, Western fruit trees, and
new breeds of horses and cattle. All these
efforts have done much to improve the economic
conditions, thus elevating the scale
of living. People eat better food and more
of it, live in better houses, and wear better
clothes than they did fifty or more years ago,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;120]</span>
and&mdash;an important item&mdash;they pay less taxes
in proportion to their income. A general
uplifting process is modifying their life and
thought, and this is profoundly affecting
Japan's working classes, and, of course,
her women.</p>

<p class="indent">In regard to the specific evils introduced
by Western industrialism, we have already
seen how the government has sought to remedy
the difficulties, so far as laws can go,
but hitherto its efforts have largely been
thwarted by capitalists.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the notable efforts of the government
to promote wise social reform movements
have been the large gatherings, at
considerable government expense, of leaders
of philanthropic and benevolent institutions
for instruction in the most recent
and approved sociological principles. Competent
specialists from all over the country
have been employed to instruct these leaders,
and thus the whole country is given the benefit
of the special knowledge of the few. The
government has also, during the past four
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;121]</span>
years, distributed some forty thousand yen
annually among those eleemosynary institutions
which it regards as models of
efficiency.</p>

<p class="indent">Furthermore, opportunity for the higher
education of women, first given on a wide
scale during the past decade, while not yet
affecting working women to any appreciable
extent, cannot fail to do so as time passes,
for it proclaims the intrinsic ability of
woman and gives her a standing of intellectual
equality with man, in sharp contrast
to the humiliating position assigned to her
by popular Buddhism, which has taught that
women must be reborn as men before they
can be saved. Indeed, they are born women
because of their sins. A Japanese proverb
has it that one must never trust a woman,
even if she has borne you seven children!
This long-believed doctrine as to the inherent
incapacity and essential depravity of woman
has no doubt been a powerful cause of her
social degradation. Under the present system
of general education, however, these
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;122]</span>
doctrines and beliefs will soon be completely
overthrown, thus making room for and producing
great changes in the social and industrial
conditions of all women.</p>

<p class="indent">But the government is not the sole worker
for the social amelioration of industrial conditions.
Through private effort forces are
being introduced which are more potent than
any the government knows or can control. I
refer to the gospel of Jesus Christ. This
has already introduced such a leaven into
Japanese society that nothing can now prevent
its transforming the whole mass in
time.</p>

<p class="indent">Should the entire foreign body of 624
Protestant and 371 Roman Catholic missionaries
be withdrawn from Japan, there would
still remain (January, 1914) 728 ordained
and 713 unordained Japanese Protestant
pastors and trained evangelists, and 331
Bible women. Among the 815 organized
churches, 182 are wholly self-supporting.
In addition to the 90,000 Protestant communicants,
67,000 Roman Catholic people, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;123]</span>
32,000 Greek Christians among the Japanese,
it is estimated by Christian pastors
that there are many hundreds of thousands
of the people who are conducting their lives
according to the principles and with the
spirit of Jesus.</p>

<p class="indent">Furthermore, a careful study of modern
Japanese civilization shows that the Christian
conception of man as having intrinsic
and inherent worth has been embodied in
the constitution and laws of the land and is
being put into wide practise. The rights
of children, women, and inferiors and the
duties of parents, husbands, and superiors
are new notes in Japan, and are sounding
forth a richer music than has ever before
been heard in the Orient.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course there are still discordant notes,
as we have seen when considering the subject
of the buying and selling of geisha and
prostitutes; but so there are even in so-called
Christian lands. Nevertheless, the
conception of the value of the individual and
of his rights is inspiring a hope among the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;124]</span>
lowly and hitherto downtrodden and oppressed
sections of the nation which cannot
be extinguished, and will in due time powerfully
transform the traditional civilization,
giving to woman a place of equality
along with man in the estimation of all.</p>

<p class="indent">The general education of girls, and especially
their higher education, is signal proof
of a wide acceptance of Christian conceptions.
According to the <i>Résumé Statistique</i>
(1914), there were, in 1911-12, 250 girls'
high schools, public and private, whose pupils
numbered 64,809. In addition, the number
of women in normal schools preparing
to become elementary school-teachers was
8,271, and in the higher normal schools, 570.
The number of female teachers is reported
at 42,739. These girls' high and normal
schools, through the ability they give their
graduates to converse with men on a basis
of intellectual equality in regard to topics
of current interest while retaining their modesty
and personal character, are so transforming
the reticent habits and unsocial customs
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;125]</span>
of Japanese ladies that ere long scant
room will be left for the old-time geisha.</p>

<p class="indent">The change Christianity is silently bringing
to the home life of Japan, adding to
its sweetness, purity, and conscious unity, and
contributing a mighty uplift to both head
and heart, few as yet have either eyes to see
or ears to hear. The influence already exerted
by Christian ideas and ideals on the traditional
conceptions of Japan in regard to
home life, marriage, childhood, the poor
and lowly, the orphan, the blind, the leper,
and the diseased generally,&mdash;in a word on
the value of the individual and his inalienable,
God-given rights,&mdash;is so widespread
and so beneficent that it receives little specific
comment and no opposition.</p>

<p class="indent">There were no doubt in old Japan certain
influences predisposing many to the new
ideals and practises introduced from the
West. It is difficult, perhaps impossible,
at this stage in Japan's development to reckon
accurately how much of Japan's new life is
due to new factors introduced from Christendom,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;126]</span>
and how much to ideals already
operative in the feudal system. No one can
doubt, however, that Christian ideals have
been the most important factors in the West
to give woman her present status. Nor can
we doubt that Christian ideals and practises
are playing an important rôle in the modern
emancipation of women in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">Those who criticize missionaries as forcing
the Christian religion upon unwilling
peoples know not whereof they speak. The
Christian faith would make no progress
whatever in Japan were it not found by Japanese
themselves to be ennobling and satisfying.
It is welcomed because it brings hope
and peace and power to those who were
hopeless and restless and powerless.</p>

<p class="indent">But he is very shortsighted who thinks
that the main forces Christianizing Japan
are wielded by the foreign missionary. The
missionary doubtless is an essential agent,
but of far more importance is the work of
Japanese Christians themselves; and in addition
to these is the general though vague
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;127]</span>
influence exerted by Western civilization as
a whole, and particularly by the English language
and literature. In that important
work, <i>Fifty Years of New Japan</i>, are many
remarkable chapters, but especially noteworthy
are those entitled "Social Changes
of New Japan," and "Influence of the West
upon Japan," from the pens of competent,
wide-awake Japanese scholars.</p>

<p class="indent">Consider what Professor Nitobe says:
"The greatest influence of the West is, after
all, the spiritual.... Christianity has influenced
the thought and lives of many individuals
in Japan, and will influence many
more, eventually affecting the nation through
the altered view-point and personnel of the
citizen and the administrator. The character-changing
power of the religion of Jesus
I believe to be only just now making itself
appreciably evident in our midst." Somewhat
further on, referring to the English
language, he writes: "The effect of the
acquisition of the English tongue on the mental
habits&mdash;I had almost said on the unconscious
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;128]</span>
cerebrations of our people&mdash;is incalculable....
The moral influence of some
of its simple text-books used in our schools
cannot be overrated.... They have been instrumental
in opening new vistas of thought
and vast domains of enterprise and interest
to young minds."</p>

<p class="indent">No student of Japan's new life, resulting
from the influence of Western and Christian
ideas and ideals, should fail to familiarize
himself with the eighth issue (1910) of <i>The
Christian Movement in Japan</i>, which gives a
series of remarkable addresses delivered by
Japanese and foreigners at the semicentennial
celebration of the beginning of Protestant
missions in Japan. Especial attention should
be paid to the section treating of the "Influence
of Christianity on Japanese Thought
and Life."</p>

<p class="indent">It will be obvious to any thoughtful person
that changes so wide and deep, affecting
all the fundamental conceptions of life, of
manhood and womanhood, of the state, of law
and justice, of right and duty, are not confined
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;129]</span>
to those whose privilege it is to study
Western books and acquire the higher education.
In ten thousand ways the whole national
life is being transformed, slowly it may
be and silently, yet surely and steadily. And
the benefits are accruing to the most lowly
and least educated no less than to those at
the top. All the working women of Japan
have already received in some degree, and
in the future will more and more receive,
the blessings and the uplift which are coming
to the nation through its contact with
the Christian conceptions and standards embedded
in Western civilization and literature.</p>

<p class="indent">A volume&mdash;nay, many volumes&mdash;would be
needed to tell in detail the story of how
the Christian message has been and is being
conveyed to the people of Japan. We should
make known the story of Joseph Hardy
Neesima, of the Kumamoto Band, of Dr.
Clark and Dr. Hepburn, of Young Men's
Christian Association teachers of English in
government schools, of faithful, self-sacrificing
pastors, evangelists, Bible women, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;130]</span>
missionaries. We should recount the deeds
of heroic lay Christians in all the walks of
life, and above all in their homes, too often
hostile, commending their new-found faith
by their new spirit and life. We should
tell of the work of Christian teachers of
ethics in the prisons, and the remarkable results
secured. We should relate the experiences
of those who have struggled for the
rights of prostitutes, of Salvation Army officers,
of matrons of reform homes, of managers
of ex-convicts' homes, of founders of
orphan asylums, of supporters of private
charity hospitals. We should tell the story
of the scores of Christian institutions the
central aim of which is to express in concrete
life the Christian's faith and hope and
love.</p>

<p class="indent">But in addition to the narrative of direct
Christian work, full heed should be given
to the evidences of the wide acceptance by
the nation of the best Christian ideals in
matters of philanthropy. To meet the needs
of the famine sufferers in north Japan during
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;131]</span>
the winter and spring of 1914, and of
those who were deprived of their all by the
terrific volcanic explosion of the island of
Sakurajima in January, 1914, more than a
million yen ($500,000) of private gifts
flowed into the hands of the relieving committees.
For the earthquake sufferers the
Diet voted 622,883 yen ($311,441).</p>

<p class="indent">The late Emperor, shortly before his
death, was so moved by the medical needs
of the poor that he contributed a fund of
a million yen for the systematic undertaking
of medical work in all parts of Japan. This
started a movement among the wealthy which
has resulted in the establishment of a Medical
Relief Association (Saiseikwai), having a
fund of $5,000,000 already paid in and
pledges for $8,000,000 more.</p>

<p class="indent">Men of wealth in Japan are following the
example set by the best Christian life in
the West. In recent years several large
gifts have been made for education. At the
close of 1913 one of the most wealthy and
always generous families of Japan, Sumitomo
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span>
of Osaka, announced their decision to establish
an industrial school for the poor, at an
expense of $200,000. And in the same year
Mr. O'Hara, one of the wealthiest and most
philanthropic men of Okayama, announced
his plan of opening a high-grade agricultural
school for poor boys of that prefecture.
The amount of the gift is not stated, but in
addition to the large sum needed for buildings
and equipment, he donates as permanent
endowment some 250 acres of rice land
whose value, roughly estimated, may be about
$50,000.</p>

<p class="indent">There are in Japan of all denominations
and religions the following institutions for
the uplift and regeneration of the downtrodden
and for the help of the poor:</p>

<table style="width:50%;" border="0" summary="institutions">

  <td>Orphan asylums</td>

</table>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
Of these institutions, the compiler of the
statistics states that for one Shinto and three
Buddhist, there are five Christian institutions.
The leaders and inspirers in all the
forms of philanthropic work are Christians,
as from the nature of the case might be
expected.</p>

<p class="indent">"In the matter of Christian Social Service,"
writes A. D. Hail, in the <i>Japan Evangelist</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
"the Federated Missions have been
represented by two Committees whose fields
of endeavor are quite distinct. The one is
the excellent Eleemosynary Committee. It
deals with the delinquents, defectives, and
dependents of society....</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_8" id="Footnote_1_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_8"><span class="label">[8]</span>
</a> January, 1915.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">"The Industrial Welfare Committee seeks
to Christianize the industrial classes, and
to encourage the development of dealing
upon Christian principles with the complicated
questions growing out of the relations
of capital and labor. By the industrial
classes we mean the non-capitalistic laborers
and bread-winners. It includes men, women,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>
and many thousands of children. They do
not own the machinery they handle, and have
no voice in the control of the industries with
which they are connected. Being without
any say in the control of factories, machines,
and raw material, they can be discharged at
any moment by employers for reasons satisfactory
alone to themselves. Their bodies,
their minds, and oftentime their morals, become
subservient to foremen and managers.
The unskilled laborers in particular have no
margin of either wages or time for wholesome
recreations, for accidents, old age,
widowhood, and unemployment. Besides
these there is another large class in Japan,
of small traders who rent their shops and
eke out earnings by the sweating process,
or by renting rooms for doubtful purposes.
To these are to be added fishermen who do
not own tackle, tenant farmers and their employees,
and the main body of school-teachers;
also an army engaged in transportation,
together with postal clerks, postmen, and
others. Incidental to this are the districts
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;135]</span>
of large cities and mining camps, where there
are congested populations of unskilled laborers
subjected to diseases occasioned by
bad drainage, inadequate housing, and all
the consequent evils. As these do not earn
sufficient wages to entitle them to vote, they
have no voice whatever in the betterment of
their surroundings....</p>

<p class="indent">"There is a growing tendency toward the
fixedness of a gulf between laborers and
their employers, so much so that Japan's
great danger in this direction is that she may
fail to realize that she has a labor problem
on hand, and one that can be solved here,
as elsewhere, only on the basis of Christian
principles of common fair dealing."</p>

<p class="indent">In spite, however, of abundant evidence
that Christian ethical and philanthropic
ideals are receiving wide acceptance in
Japan, far wider than would be suggested
by the statistics of membership in the Christian
churches, it is also true that the evils
of Occidental industrialism and materialism
are sweeping in like a flood.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;136]</span>
Turning now from general statements as
to the ethico-industrial conditions of the
working women of Japan, in the next chapter
I give the story of a single institution.

<p class="h2a">THE MATSUYAMA WORKING GIRLS' HOME</p>

<p class="cap">THE origin and history of the Matsuyama
Working Girls' Home cannot be
told apart from the story of the man who
has been its heart and life, Mr. Shinjiro
Omoto. Born in 1872 and graduating from
the common school at fourteen, he at once
went into business, first as an apprentice
and later with his father. At nineteen he
opened a sugar store, which flourished and
before long overshadowed the father's business.
Money came in so easily that he soon
entered on a life of licentiousness, and for
several years he was as famous for his
drunken carousals as he had been for his
phenomenal business success. His parents cut
him off, refused him admittance to the house,
and for years he did not even speak to his
father.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;138]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i156" id="i156"></a>

<span class="caption">MATSUYAMA WORKING GIRLS&#39; HOME<br />
GIRLS IN THE MATSUYAMA HOME</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">In 1899, we held a preaching service in
a theater. Mr. Omoto happened to be drinking
in the saloon opposite. Hearing of our
gathering, with some rowdy comrades, he
thought he would break it up, with the
result that we experienced persistent opposition
throughout the meeting. But the
sermons on Pessimism and the New Life, and
my statement of the reasons that had brought
me to Japan attracted his attention, and the
next day I received an anonymous letter asking
for tracts. These seem to have produced
a profound impression, particularly the tract
entitled "Two Young Men." It told of two
hardened prisoners who had been transformed
by the gospel and became highly useful
and well-known members of society. Mr.
Omoto thereupon set himself definitely to
learn about Christianity, but privately, unwilling
to make public his new hope. He
bought and read through, quite by himself,
the entire New Testament. Though he
gained some idea of the gospel, he soon found
he had lost none of his passion for drink.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;139]</span>
After a while he went to Kobe and joined
a temperance society; but soon finding that
the society had members who broke their
pledges, he began to break his. In despair
he went to Okayama and tried to join himself
to Mr. Ishii, head of the well-known
Christian orphanage, asking to be made a
Christian, but he was told to return to Matsuyama
and join the church there in his old
home; only so could he be saved. Greatly
disappointed, he returned and called on me
early in June, 1901, but without telling fully
about himself. He also called on Mr. Nishimura,
an earnest Christian worker, who
prayed with him, telling him that to be
saved he must receive the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">That summer, quite exceptionally, I returned
in the middle of the vacation. Mr.
Omoto appeared at the prayer-meeting for
the first time and was evidently in a state
of great excitement, so much so that only
with difficulty could we understand his remarks
and his prayer. The gist was that
he had that day received the Holy Spirit,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
that he was now saved, and that his joy was
too great for utterance. Tears rolled down
his cheeks as he talked and prayed. After
the meeting I had a few words with him,
and urged him to ally himself with our experienced
workers. He was so excited that
I feared for him, and wondered whether this
might not be a tornado of emotion due to
drink and to the nervous condition incident
to his riotous life, an emotion which he mistook
for the gift of the Holy Spirit. I urged
him to begin at once to live the Christian
life, cutting loose from all bad companions
and bad habits.</p>

<p class="indent">To gain an honest living he entered the
Matsuyama Cotton Thread Spinning Factory.
This required twelve hours of work
daily, sometimes by day and sometimes by
night, a hard pull for one who had done no
steady work for years. He attended Christian
services faithfully, so far as his hours of
work allowed, and became quite intimate
with two or three of our best Christians. Before
long he began to talk about the wretched
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;141]</span>
conditions and immoral life of the factory
girls, telling us of the situation already described
in Chapter IX.<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> His first thought was
to give these tired children wholesome recreation.
He secured the use of our preaching
place in the vicinity of the factory and invited
the girls to attend what he called the
Dojokwai (Sympathy Society). He soon
persuaded the girls to add a little reading
and writing to their play, and later also,
sewing. These meetings had of course to
be held after the twelve or more hours of
work in the factory had been completed.
Care had also to be taken that the studies and
the fun should not absorb time needed for
sleep. Membership in the Sympathy Society
rose rapidly and soon numbered seventy
girls.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

  <a href="#FNanchor_1_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
  See pages <a href="#FmFN09">67-69</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">At first meetings were held only in the
evening three times a week, and lasted but
an hour. But as the educational element of
the society developed, others were induced
to help and every evening save Sunday was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;142]</span>
occupied. In order that girls on the night
shift might continue their studies similar
classes were also held from seven to nine
o'clock in the morning. Before six months
had passed the play aspect of the society was
largely superseded by the educational.</p>

<p class="indent">But opposition of Buddhists now began
to show itself. A few parents refused to
let their girls attend. The most determined
opposition however came from the manager
in the factory who had charge of one of the
shifts. Members of that shift were so treated
that gradually they dropped out of the Dojokwai,
and new members from that shift
could not be secured. The hostile manager
was however himself dropped some months
later, and all opposition to the work from
within the factory ceased.</p>

<p class="indent">In a previous chapter we have noted the
facts discovered by Mr. Omoto as he went
the rounds of the boarding-houses in which
the girls were required to live.<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> As these
conditions became clearer and more appallingly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;143]</span>
impressive, he began to say with increasing
frequency and insistence that the
Sympathy Society, however successful, could
not do what was needed. Only a Christian
home would answer. Not only do the girls
need to learn to read and write and sew, but
even more than these do they need a home
free from temptation, clean and pure and
helpful, and elevating morally and religiously.
The difficulties however in the way
of such an enterprise seemed insuperable.
To say nothing of the financial problem, a
still greater obstacle, it was felt, was the
securing of "recognition" from the factory,
for Buddhist influence in the factory was at
that time still dominant. During these
months the Sympathy Society was winning
its way among the girls and their parents,
and Mr. Omoto himself was learning valuable
lessons.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_10" id="Footnote_1_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_10"><span class="label">[10]</span>
</a> See pages <a href="#FmFN10">68, 69</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">One was that the girls were not all eager
to be in a Christian home. We of course
forbade all drinking, irregular hours, and
more irregular "friendships." Attendance
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;144]</span>
on prayers, night and morning, and at the
school, was required. It looked for a time
as if we should fail, for lack of girls to
meet the expenses.</p>

<p class="indent">But in spite of discouragements we kept
on. The earnings of the girls who lived in
the home, for the first year, were 1,361 yen.
Of this sum they paid for board 905 yen,
and sent to their parents 456, whereas girls
in the other boarding-houses were able to
save nothing, although the amount paid for
board was the same in all the houses, being
fixed by the factory at 3.60 yen per month,
or twelve sen (six cents) per day.</p>

<p class="indent">In February, 1903, a representative of the
government who came from Tokyo to inspect
the conditions of labor in western Japan,
heard of the Dojokwai (Sympathy Home),
and was so much interested in the story of
its work that he took time to visit it with
several local officials. He was greatly
pleased, for he knew of nothing just like
this, in any other part of Japan, particularly
in its hygienic, educational, and moral advantages,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;145]</span>
and he expressed the wish that there
might be many such. This was our first
notice from government officials.</p>

<p class="indent">As time went on, Mr. Omoto was found
by the factory officials to be exceptionally
faithful to its interests; he was rapidly promoted
from one position to another, and in
December of the same year was made "visitor"
and "employing agent." This required
him to visit neighboring towns and villages
and collect new girls when needed. He
tried to decline this work, saying that he
could make no false promises to the girls
or to their parents, nor in any way delude
them as to the nature of their work, the
amount of their wages, the conditions of the
boarding-houses; being strictly a temperance
man, also, he could not treat with sake
(sah'-ke) and so get into friendly relations,
all of which things employing agents constantly
do; he had no expectations of gaining
any recruits; the factory would better
send some one else. They told him at least
to try. To the surprise of all, and of himself
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;146]</span>
the most, from his first trip he brought
back with him fifteen girls. For three years
he continued in this work and was always
successful in securing girls for the factory.
Because of his refusal to touch liquor in any
form, his traveling expenses were much less
than those of other employing agents, much
to the satisfaction of the management; and
the girls he secured on the whole remained
longer and more contentedly at work, because
he had always told them the truth.
This made his position in the factory more
secure and influential. After about two
years' employment by the day he was promoted
to the rank of a regular employee and
paid by the month. His hours of official
service were also largely reduced in order
that he might have time for his educational
and Christian work in the Home&mdash;a striking
testimony of appreciation on the part of the
factory officials.</p>

<p class="indent">As the months passed by it gradually became
clear that the effectiveness as well as
the permanence of the work demanded suitable
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;147]</span>
quarters. The heavy rental paid for
the house made self-support impossible. Results
already attained seemed to warrant appeal
to friends for gifts, for the purpose of
buying land and the erection of a building.
Responses to our appeals provided the needed
funds, land was purchased and a contract
made with a carpenter on exceptionally favorable
terms, just two days before the opening
of the Russo-Japanese war (February,
1904). Immediately prices went up by leaps
and bounds; but our contract was so well
made and the carpenter had already made
such full subcontracts for the lumber, etc.,
that we were not troubled because of war
prices.</p>

<p class="indent">As we entered our new quarters in June,
1904, however, the factory shut down the
main part of its work and discharged the
majority of its workers. This was a severe
blow to the Home. The occupants were
reduced to seven girls. Although the factory
opened again after a few months, the conditions
during and after the war made it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;148]</span>
difficult for the factory to secure girls, and
the Home, together with the other boarding-houses,
suffered from lack of boarders. Beginning
with March, 1907, however, special
circumstances combined to fill the Home to
its utmost capacity; during the three months
of April, May, and June thirty applicants
were refused admittance and as many more
who desired to enter the school were
declined.</p>

<p class="indent">Increasing acquaintance with the disastrous
effects of factory labor,&mdash;the lint-filled
air so often producing consumption, and
the excessive heat of summer sometimes resulting
even in sunstroke,&mdash;made Mr. Omoto
unwilling to persuade girls to enter upon
such a life. The needs of the Home also
pressed upon his time. These considerations
led him, in 1906, to give up his work
in the factory altogether, in order to devote
his entire time and strength to the Home and
to the upbuilding of the moral and religious
life of the girls.</p>

<p class="indent"><a name="FmFN11" id="FmFN11"></a>In July, 1906, Mr. Omoto attended in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;149]</span>
Osaka the first convention of factory officials
convened to study the problem of the proper
care of operatives. Representatives were
present from sixteen factories having night
schools, and specimens of the work of the
girls were compared.
Mr. Omoto was fairly
lionized because of the superior quality of
the work sent in from our Home and many
newspapers made special mention of him and
his work.</p>

<p class="indent">In September, 1908, there was held in
Tokyo under the auspices of the Home Department
of the Imperial government an
eight weeks' school of applied sociology.
Mr. Omoto was among the 376 persons who
attended. Again he received exceptional attention
and was asked to tell his story. At
this school no less than thirty-six learned
specialists gave lectures on every conceivable
topic suitable for such a school. Among
the speakers so many were professed Christians,
and of the rest so many advocated
such markedly Christian ideals, that some
Buddhists are said to have taken offense, regarding
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;150]</span>
the whole affair as a part of the
Christian propaganda.</p>

<p class="indent">In the spring of 1909 there occurred an
event of considerable significance. Without
a preliminary hint of what was happening,
Mr. Omoto saw in the paper one day the
amazing statement that the Matsuyama
Working Girls' Home, along with seventy-nine
other selected institutions throughout
the country, was the recipient of a specified
sum (200 yen) as a mark of government
approval! A total of 40,000 yen were thus
distributed in varying amounts, Christian
institutions being recognized to an unexpected
degree. Later, word came from the
Prefectural Office summoning him to receive
the gift. In the entire prefecture six institutions
had been thus honored, and of these,
two were Christian. This gift from the Department
of the Interior has been repeated
each year since.</p>

<p class="indent">Again in May, 1910, a Conference of Social
Service Workers (Chu-o Jizen Kyokwai)
was held at Nagoya at the time of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
Exposition, and Mr. Omoto was among those
invited to attend. His address and statistical
report received much attention. Mr. Tomeoka,
representative of the government and
chairman of the conference, spoke in unstinted
praise of the work of the Home,
which he characterized as "Kokka Jigyo"
(a national enterprise), and recommended
the adoption by others of several of its special
features.</p>

<p class="indent">In the spring of 1911, the Home Department
of the central government published a
small volume describing one hundred and
thirteen model philanthropic institutions of
the country, in which we were of course
pleased to see that the Home was included,
being the only one from the prefecture.</p>

<p class="indent">As opportunity offered and means were
available, following the advice of friends,
four small adjacent lots were purchased, one
of which we were almost forced to secure
for self-protection, because of the evil character
of the buildings upon it. We now
own altogether about two acres of land on
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span>
the north side of the beautiful Castle Hill,
around which Matsuyama is built. Here
have been erected at different times six buildings
(three of them two-storied), for residential,
dormitory, chapel, night school,
weaving, hospital, bath, and other purposes.
We have space for a playground, of which
the girls joyously avail themselves, after returning
from twelve hours of confinement in
the dust and clatter of machinery. The garden,
too, provides fresh vegetables of an
assured character at a minimum of expense,
adding much to the variety and the wholesomeness
of the diet. The present value of
the property is more than its original cost,
for land and buildings are constantly rising
in price, as is the case in other parts of the
country.</p>

<p class="indent">The city educational authorities in 1906
asked Mr. Omoto to open his night school
to the poor of the district. For this he had
to have a regular school license from the
National Bureau of Education at Tokyo.
This was to be a Christian school&mdash;the only
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;153]</span>
license of exactly that kind in the empire,
he was told.</p>

<p class="indent">Industrial newspapers have been noticing
the Home and its work for some time.<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> During
the past five years the favorable attitude
of local and national government officials
has been particularly pronounced. Government
inspectors have repeatedly been sent
from the Prefectural Office and occasionally
even from Tokyo to visit the Home. One
such expressed himself as amazed at the
excellent mental work done by the girls, in
view of the fact that all their study takes
place after twelve hours of toil. Nothing
but good food, sufficient sleep, and a wholesome
and happy home life could account for
their splendid health and superior school
work. One man remarked that the girls in
the Home do better work than pupils in the
same grade in public schools.</p>

<p class="indent">Even so early as the autumn of 1906 the
Home Department of the central government
sent down special instructions to the prefectural
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;154]</span>
office in Matsuyama to investigate
our work, with the result that of nine benevolent
institutions throughout Japan selected
for commendation, ours was the one most
carefully described and unqualifiedly praised.
A recent government pamphlet concerning
industrial problems makes special reference,
covering two pages, to the work of the Home.
Thus has a small institution begun to serve
as a model for the country.</p>

<p class="indent">The good health of the girls in our Home
has been in strong contrast with the health
of those in other boarding-houses, even in the
best dormitories of the best factories in other
cities.</p>

<p class="indent">Statistics recently compiled by the government
show that the average death-rate
among factory operatives throughout the
country is extraordinarily high. The highest,
fifty per cent. on account of an epidemic, was
reported from a certain factory owned and
managed boarding-house in Niigata prefecture.
Not one girl has ever died in our
Home. Of the 301 girls who had lived in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;155]</span>
our Home by 1911, only eight, all told,
died.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1912 the Home passed through a crisis
that threatened to destroy it. Late in 1911
the one factory in Matsuyama, where all the
girls worked, was sold out to parties living
in Osaka. A new manager was sent down
who introduced many drastic changes. The
change most affecting us was the stopping
of the night work and the lengthening of day
work to fourteen hours: namely, from 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
till 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p class="indent">The girls in the Home soon became dissatisfied,
and not many months passed before
all had left the factory. Mr. Omoto was
urged by the manager to find and bring in
new girls. He refused however on the
ground that he could not ask anybody to
work such brutally long hours.</p>

<p class="indent">Had it not been for a little weaving department
with which we had already been
experimenting, the Home would have been
compelled to close. More looms were secured
and those girls who wished to remain
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;156]</span>
with us were given opportunity for work.
Mr. Omoto's attention was at that time directed
to the condition of the weaving girls
in the scores and even hundreds of little establishments
in the city and its suburbs. He
soon found that an educational, economic,
moral, and religious condition existed among
them not unlike that which he had found
among the factory girls of Matsuyama a
dozen years before. The weaving establishments
are, as a rule, small private affairs,
usually having less than ten girls each,
and are therefore wholly outside of the supervision
of the government. The treatment
of workers and the hours of labor are entirely
settled by the individual owners.</p>

<p class="indent">As a rule the girls are apprenticed for
from two to three years immediately on
leaving the primary school, at an age therefore
of twelve or thirteen. They barely
earn their living, although they work from
daybreak to ten or eleven at night, and in
some establishments even till midnight&mdash;from
fifteen to eighteen hours a day! There are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
no night shifts and rare holidays on occasional
festivals. The hygienic and moral
conditions are about as bad as can be. It
is estimated that one half of the girls are
ruined before the close of their apprenticeship.
Our Home is now deliberately attacking
the new problem, which in many respects
is more difficult than was the old one. We
have put up two small buildings on our own
grounds, enabling us to have thirty looms to
give opportunity for work to thirty girls.</p>

<p class="indent">The uniform quality of the cloth produced
by our girls, the central portions of each
piece equaling the ends in quality, shows unflagging
moral attention, without effort to
rush the work and stint the material; this
has already won such approval from merchants
that the "Sympathy Home" brand
can be sold for a little more than other
brands, and Mr. Omoto is assured that there
is no limit to the amount which could be
marketed.</p>

<p class="indent">An owner of several weaving establishments
has become so impressed with the quality
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;158]</span>
of the work and the character developed
in our girls that he asked Mr. Omoto if he
would not take charge of a hundred of his
weaving girls. This new departure is especially
promising, for we have complete supervision
of the girls throughout the entire
twenty-four hours. The girls, moreover, are
already remaining in our Home as a rule
much longer than they used to when getting
work in the spinning factory.</p>

<p class="indent">As successive chapters of this book have
shown, no more urgent problem faces New
Japan than that of the moral development
of her workers. This is particularly true
of the hundreds of thousands of girls in the
larger and smaller factories and industrial
establishments. The wretched physical, economic,
social, and moral conditions under
which the majority of these girls lived and
worked at the time when our Home was
started are not easily described.</p>

<p class="indent">Many of the factory authorities<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span>
neither ignorant nor unmindful of the situation,
and are striving to remedy it. The government
also has enacted laws not a few.
But laws and official actions alone provide
no adequate solution of the serious problems
raised by the extraordinary industrial and
social transformations sweeping over Japan.
A new spirit must be evoked, both on the part
of capital and labor, and new moral ideals
and relations established. This cannot be
done by laws alone. Only love and contagious
personal example are sufficient for
the needs.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_12" id="Footnote_1_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_12"><span class="label">[12]</span>
</a> It is not to be inferred from the statements in this book that the
political leaders and the organizers of industrial Japan have been
dependent on our Home for ideas and ideals in regard to the problems
raised by modern industry. Many of those leaders are men of cosmopolitan
education and are well versed in the best and most recent of literature
of the West on these matters. It is true, however, that our Home has
been an important concrete experiment affording in Japan valuable
suggestions and stimulus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Our Home was designed to meet just such
a situation and has to a remarkable degree,
we think, succeeded. It has provided not
only sufficient fresh air, nourishing food,
adequate bedding, clean rooms, and wholesome
recreation, but also moral and religious
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;160]</span>
instruction, and some education. The
girls in our Home have enjoyed conspicuously
better health and have done better
work and earned and sent to their parents
more money than those of the other boarding-houses
of Matsuyama. But better than
these have been the educational, moral, and
religious results. Their womanhood has been
raised. They have been better fitted for life's
duties and for motherhood than they would
have been without the training which has
been given them.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, the results of the Home have
been such as to break down opposition. The
good-will and cooperation of the factory
officials were won. Factories in other parts
of the country also have recognized our
Home as presenting a splendid ideal which,
in a measure, many of them are already following.
The local and the central governments,
as already shown, have repeatedly sent
officials to inspect us, and in their reports
have not only praised us, but have described
our Home in detail, saying that we have
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
solved the difficult problem of how to care
for factory hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Through the Home we are reaching the
lowest strata of the working classes of Japan,
and are providing them with ideals, motives,
and education, and in a way, too, which does
not tend to pauperize them, for each girl
pays as board a sum sufficient to cover actual
living expenses. It is also exerting an influence
on the townsfolk. The attitude of
the people toward Christianity has undergone
a marked change. Villages in the interior
likewise have altered their attitude
on seeing how their daughters, graduates of
our Home, have improved both in intelligence
and character, in marked contrast to
those who have been in other boarding-houses.
All in all, Mr. Omoto has attained
remarkable success. He is absorbed, heart
and soul, in his work of bettering the moral
and religious conditions of the working girls
of Japan, and is a man continuously growing
in spiritual life, Christian character, and
knowledge of men. I have never known a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
man more thoroughly converted or more enthusiastic
in his chosen field of work. The
Omoto of to-day is a different person from
the reformed debauchee of thirteen years
ago, who began this service for factory girls
as the outcome of his sincere question, "Lord,
what wilt thou have me to do?" His family
have become possessed with the idea of
social service, and his five children are being
brought up in this atmosphere and in the
fear of the Lord.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus has the Matsuyama Working Girls'
Home survived many threatening vicissitudes,
attained conspicuous successes, and is
now embarked on a new line of endeavor.
May it exceed in the future its successes of
the past and make still more substantial contributions
to the uplift of the working women
of Japan!</p>

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
